# Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 1992

{==

**Donna Harman, Overview of the First Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-1):**

The overall goal of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) was to address these two missing elements. It is hoped that by providing a very large test collection, and encouraging interaction with other groups in a friendly evaluation forum, a new thrust in information retrieval will occur. There is also an increased interest in this field within the DARPA community, and TREC is designed to be a showcase of the state-of-the-art in retrieval research. MST's goal as co-sponsor of TREC is to encourage communication and technology transfer among academia, industry, and government.
