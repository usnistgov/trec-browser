In the TREC 2001 Interactive Track six research teams carried out observational studies which increased the realism of the searching by allowing the use of data and search systems/tools publicly accessible via the Internet. To the extent possible, searchers were allowed to choose tasks and systems/tools for accomplishing those tasks.
