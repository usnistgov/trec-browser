New in TREC-2001 was the Video Track, the goal of which was to promote progress in content-based retrieval from digital video via open, metric-based evaluation. The trak built on publily available video provided by the Open Video Project of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under Gary Marchionini, the NIST Digital Video Library, and stock shot video provided for TREC-2001 by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The track used very nice work on shot boundary evaluation done as part of the ISIS Coordinated Researh Project (AIM, 2001).
