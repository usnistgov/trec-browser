# Overview - Filtering 2002

[`Proceedings`](./proceedings.md), [`Data`](./data.md), [`Runs`](./runs.md), [`Participants`](./participants.md)

{==

Given a topic description and some example relevant documents, build a filtering profile which will select the most relevant examples from an incoming stream of documents.  In the TREC 2002 filtering task we will continue to stress adaptive filtering. However, the batch filtering and routing tasks will also be available.
