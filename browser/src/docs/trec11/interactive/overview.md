TREC is organized along several tracks, each of which addresses a particular retrieval problem or scenario. The high-level goal of the Interactive Track is the investigation of searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome. The remainder of this page comprises information basic to the definition of the track for TREC-11. For additional information about TREC and its schedules see the TREC homepage.
