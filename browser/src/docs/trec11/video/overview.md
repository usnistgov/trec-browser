TREC-2002 saw the second running of the Video Track, the goal of which was to promote progress in content-based retrieval from digital video via open, metrics-based evaluation. The track used 73.3 hours of publicly available digital video (in MPEG1/VCD format) downloaded by the participants directly from the Internet Archive (Prelinger Archives) and some from the Open Video Project. The material comprised advertising, educational, industrial, and amateur films produced between the 1930’s and the 1970’s by corporations, nonprofit organizations, trade associations, community and interest groups, educational institutions, and individuals. 17 teams representing 5 companies and 12 universities — 4 from Asia, 9 from Europe, and 4 from the US — participated in one or more of three tasks in the 2001 video track: shot boundary determination, feature extraction, and search (manual or interactive). Results were scored by NIST using manually created truth data for shot boundary determination and manual assessment of feature extraction and search results.
