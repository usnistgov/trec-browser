The TREC-2002 Web Track moved away from non-Web relevance ranking and towards Webspecific tasks on a 1.25 million page crawl “.GOV”. The topic distillation task involved finding pages which were relevant, but also had characteristics which would make them desirable inclusions in a distilled list of key pages. The named page task is a variant of last year’s homepage finding task. The task is to find a particular page, but in this year’s task the page need not be a home page.
