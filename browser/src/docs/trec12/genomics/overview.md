The first year of TREC Genomics Track featured two tasks: ad hoc retrieval and information extraction. Both tasks centered around the Gene Reference into Function (GeneRIF) resource of the National Library of Medicine, which was used as both pseudorelevance judgments for ad hoc document retrieval as well as target text for information extraction. The track attracted 29 groups who participated in one or both tasks.
