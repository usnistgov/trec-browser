The goal of this track is to bring the user out of hiding, making him or her an integral part of both the search process and the evaluation. Systems do not have just a query to chew on, but also have as much information as possible about the person making the request, ranging from biographical data, through information seeking context, to expected type of result. The HARD track is a variant of the ad-hoc retrieval task from the past. It was a “pilot” track in 2003 because of the substantial extension on past evaluation—i.e., it is not clear how best to evaluate some of the aspects of the track, so at least for this year it was intended to be very open ended.
