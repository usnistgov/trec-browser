??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The TREC 2003 question answering track contained two tasks, the passages task and the main task. In the passages task, systems returned a single text snippet in response to factoid questions; the evaluation metric was the number of snippets that contained a correct answer. The main task contained three separate types of questions, factoid questions, list questions, and definition questions. Each of the questions was tagged as to its type and the different question types were evaluated separately. The final score for a main task run was a combination of the scores for the separate question types. This paper defines the various tasks included in the track and reports the evaluation results. Since the TREC 2003 track was the first time for significant participation in the definition and list subtasks, the paper also examines the reliability of the evaluation for these tasks.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this our first participation in TREC we have focused on the passage task of the question answering track. The main aim of our participation was to test the impact of various types of linguistic information in a simple question answering system. In particular, we have tested various combinations of word overlap, grammatical relations overlap, and overlap of minimal logical forms in the final scoring module of the system. The results indicate a small increase of accuracy with respect to a baseline system based on word overlap. Overall, given the short time available for developing the system, the results are satisfactory and equal or surpass the median.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The systems entered by the University of Sheffield in the question answering track of previous TRECs have been developments of the system first entered in TREC 8 (Humphreys et al., 1999). Although a range of improvements have been made to the system over the last four years (Scott and Gaizauskas, 2000; Greenwood et al., 2002), none has resulted in a significant performance increase. For this reason it was decided to approach the TREC 2003 evaluation more as a learning experience than as a forum in which to promote a particular approach to QA. We view this as the beginning of a process that will lead to much fuller appreciation of how to build more effective QA systems. [...]

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We participated in the Robust, HARD and part of the QA tracks in TREC2003. For Robust track, a new way of doing ad-hoc retrieval based on web assistance was introduced. For HARD track, we followed the guideline to generate clarification forms for each topic so as to experiment with user feedback and metadata. In QA, we only did the factoid experiment. The approach to QA was similar to what we have used before, except that WWW searching was added as a front-end processing. These experiments are described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Language Computer Corporation's Question Answering system combines the strengths of Information Extraction (IE) techniques with the vastness of axiomatic knowledge representations derived from Word-Net for justifying answers that are extracted from the AQUAINT text collection. CICERO LITE, the named entity recognizer employed in LCC's QA system was able to recognize precisely a large set of entities that ranged over an extended set of semantic categories. Similarly, the semantic hierarchy of answer types was also enhanced. To improve the precision of answer min-ing, the QA system also relied on a theorem prover that was able to produce abductive justifications of the answers when it had access to the axiomatic transformations of the WordNet glosses. This combination of techniques was successful and furthermore, produced little difference between the exact extractions and the paragraph extractions.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at UMass Amherst participated in two tracks for TREC 2003: High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) and Question Answering (QA). In the HARD track, we developed document metadata to correspond to query metadata requirements; implemented clarification forms based on query expansion, passage retrieval, and clustering; and retrieved variable length passages deemed most likely to be relevant. This work is discussed at length in Section 1. In the QA track, we focused on retrieving passages that were likely to contain the answer to the question.

	This paper describes a new version of the DIOGENE Question Answering (QA) system developed at ITC-Irst. The recent updates here presented are targeted to the participation to TREC-2003 and meet the specific requirements of this year's QA main task. In particular, extending the backbone already developed for our participation to the last two editions of the QA track, special attention was paid to deal with the principal novelty factors of the new challenge, namely the introduction of the so-called definition and list questions. Moreover, we experimented with a first attempt to integrate parsing as a deeper linguistic analysis technique to find similarities between the syntactic structure of the input questions and the retrieved text passages. The outcome of such experiments, as well as the variations of the system's architecture and the results achieved at TREC-2003 will be presented in the following sections.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This report describes a new open-domain answer retrieval system developed at the University of Edinburgh and gives results for the TREC-12 question answering track. Phrasal answers are identified by increasingly narrowing down the search space from a large text collection to a single phrase. The system uses document retrieval, query-based passage segmentation and ranking, semantic analysis from a wide-coverage parser, and a unification-like matching procedure to extract potential an-swers. A simple Web-based answer validation stage is also applied. The system is based on the Open Agent Architecture and has a parallel design so that multiple questions can be answered simultaneously on a Beowulf cluster.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	CL Research's question-answering system for TREC 2003 was modified away from reliance on database technology to the core underlying technology of using massive XML-tagging for processing both questions and documents. This core technology was then extended to participate in the novelty task. This technology provides many opportuinities for experimenting with various approaches to question answering and novelty determination. For the QA track, we submitted one run and our overall main task score was 0.075, with scores of 0.070 for factoid questions, 0.000 for list questions, and 0.160 for definition questions. For the passage task, we submitted two runs, our better score was 0.119 for the factoid questions. These scores were all considerably below the medians for these tasks. We have implemented further routines since our official submission, improving our scores to 0.18 and 0.23 for the exact answer and passages tasks, respectively. For the Novelty track, we submitted four runs for task 1, one run for task 2, five runs for task 3, and one run for task 4; our submissions for tasks 2 and 4 were identical. For task 1, our best run received an F-score of 0.483 for relevant sentences and 0.410 for new sentences. For task 2, our F-score was 0.788 for new sentences. For task 3, our best F-score was 0.558 for relevant sentences and 0.419 for new sentences. For task 4, our F-score was 0.655 for new sentences. On average, our F-scores were somewhat above the medians on all tasks. We describe our system and examine our results from the perspective of exploiting the metadata in the XML tags.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Many researchers have used lexical networks and ontologies to mitigate synonymy and polysemy problems in Question Answering (QA), systems coupled with taggers, query classifiers, and answer extractors in complex and ad-hoc ways. We seek to make QA systems reproducible with shared and modest human effort, carefully separating knowledge from algorithms. To this end, we propose an aesthetically “clean” Bayesian inference scheme for exploiting lexical relations for passage-scoring for QA . The factors which contribute to the efficacy of Bayesian Inferencing on lexical relations are soft word sense disambiguation, parameter smoothing which ameliorates the data sparsity problem and estimation of joint probability over words which overcomes the deficiency of naive-bayes-like approaches.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For the most part, the system we used for TREC2003 was a smooth evolution of the one we ran in TREC2002 [Chu-Carroll et al, 2003b]. We continued to use our multi-source and multi-agent architecture. For Factoid questions we used all of our previous answering agents with an additional pattern-based agent, an enhanced answer resolution algorithm, and increased coverage of the Cyc sanity checker. We will devote a portion of this paper to performing a post-mortem of our experiences with Cyc this year. For List questions, which we did not attempt previously, we ran our Factoid system with different parameters. For Definition questions we took an entirely new approach, which we call QA-by-Dossier, and which will be the other focus of this paper. While we think that our system performed reasonably well in this subtask, the NIST evaluation results do not reflect this, raising some questions about the Definition subtask specification and evaluation.

This was our second year in the track and we hoped to improve our performance relative to 2002. In the next section we outline the general strategy we adopted, the changes relative to last year and the approaches taken to the three question types, namely factoid, list and definition. Following this the individual system components are described in more detail. Thirdly, the runs we submitted are presented together with the results obtained. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on our findings.

	It is the fourth time that we take part in the QA track. Our system, FDUQA, is based on our previous system (Wu et al, 2002). FDUQA includes an offline part and an online part. We make great efforts on the online part while leaving the offline part unchanged. We have tried many natural language processing techniques, and incorporated many sources of world knowledge, including Web. A novel Query formulation technique has also been put forward. In addition, we've tried another attempt on answer extraction in this year's task. In the second section, we will describe the architecture of our QA system; and give a detailed description on the Query formulation for Web search in the third section; while in the fourth section, we will introduce our new attempt on answer extraction; and we will present our performance in the last section.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we introduce the University at Albany's question answering system, ILQUA. It is developed on the following methods: pattern matching over annotated text, web-proofing and semantic form proofing. These methods are currently used in other QA systems, however, we revised them to work together in our QA system.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC 2003, we focused on definitional questions. For factoid and list questions, we simply re-used our TREC 2002 system with some modifications. For definitional QA, we adopted a hybrid approach that combines several complementary technology components. Information retrieval (IR) was used to retrieve from the corpus the relevant documents for each question. Various linguistic and extraction tools were used to analyze the retrieved texts and to extract various types of kernel facts from which the answer to the question is generated. These tools include name finding, parsing, co-reference resolution, proposition extraction, relation extraction and extraction of structured patterns. All text analysis functions except structured pattern extraction were carried out by Serif, a state of the art information extraction engine (Ramshaw, et al, 2001) from BBN. Section 2 summarizes our submission for factoid and list qeustion answering (QA). The rest of the paper focuses on defintional questions. Section 4 concludes this work.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes a question answering system and its various modules to solve definition, factoid and list questions defined in the TREC12 Main task. In particular, we tackle the factoid QA task by Event-based Question Answering. Each QA event comprises of elements describing different facets like time, location, object, action etc. By analyzing the external knowledge from pre-retrieved TREC documents, Web documents, WordNet and Ontology to discover the QA event structure, we explore the inherent associations among QA elements and then obtain the answers. There are three subsystems working parallel to handle definition, factoid, and list questions separately. We highlight the shared modules, fine-grained named entity recognition, anaphora resolution and canonicalization co-reference resolution, among the three subsystems as well.
