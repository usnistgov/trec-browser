??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The robust retrieval track is a new track in TREC 2003. The goal of the track is to improve the consistency of retrieval technology by focusing on poorly performing topics. In addition, the track brings back a classic, ad hoc retrieval task to TREC that provides a natural home for new participants.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Our participation in TREC 2003 aims to adapt the use of the DFR (Divergence From Randomness) models with Query Expansion (QE) to the robust track and the topic distillation task of the Web track. We focus on the robust track, where the utilization of QE improves the global performance but hurts the performance on the worst topics. In particular, we study the problem of the selective application of the query expansion. We define two information theory based functions, InfoDFR and InfoQ, predicting respectively the AP (Average Precision) of queries and the AP increment of queries after the application of QE. InfoQ is used to selectively apply QE. We show that the use of InfoQ achieves the same performance comparable of the unexpanded method on the set of the worst topics, but a better performance than full QE on the entire set of topics.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We participated in the Robust, HARD and part of the QA tracks in TREC2003. For Robust track, a new way of doing ad-hoc retrieval based on web assistance was introduced. For HARD track, we followed the guideline to generate clarification forms for each topic so as to experiment with user feedback and metadata. In QA, we only did the factoid experiment. The approach to QA was similar to what we have used before, except that WWW searching was added as a front-end processing. These experiments are described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this newly introduced Robust Track, we mainly tested a novel query-based approach for the selection of the most appropriate term-weighting model. In our approach, we cluster the queries according to their statistics and associate the best-performing term-weighting model to each cluster. For a given new query, we assign a cluster to the query according to its statistical features, then apply the model associated to the cluster. As shown by the experimental results, our query-based model selection approach does improve the poorly-performing queries compared to a baseline where a unique retrieval model is applied indifferently to all queries. Moreover, it seems that query expansion has detrimental effect on the poorly-performing queries, although it significantly achieves a higher mean average precision over all the 100 queries.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This report describes the work done at Océ Research for the TREC 2003. This first participation consists of ad hoc experiments for the Robust track. We used the BM25 model and our new probabilistic model to rank documents. Knowledge Concepts' Content Enabler semantic network was used for stemming and query expansion. Our main goal was to compare the BM25 model and the probabilistic model implemented with and/or without query expansion. The developed generic probabilistic model does not use global statistics of a document collection to rank documents. The relevance of the document to a given query is calculated using term frequencies of the query terms in the document and the length of the document. Furthermore, some theoretical research has been done. We have constructed a model that uses relevance judgements of previous years. However, we did not implement it due to the time constraints.

	It is the first time that the Chinese Information Processing group of NLPR participates in TREC. Our goal in this year is to test our IR system and get some experience about the TREC evaluation. So, we select two retrieval tasks: Novelty Track and Robust Track. We build a new IR system based on two key technologies: Window-based weighting method and Semantic Tree Model for query expansion. In this paper, the IR system and some new technologies are described first, and then some detail work and results in Novelty and Robust Track are listed.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We describe our participation in the TREC 2003 Robust and Web tracks. For the Robust track, we experimented with the impact of stemming and feedback on the worst scoring topics. Our main finding is the effectiveness of stemming on poorly performing topics, which sheds new light on the role of morphological normalization in information retrieval. For both the home/named page finding and topic distillation tasks of the Web track, we experimented with different document representations and retrieval models. Our main finding is effectiveness of the anchor text index for both tasks, suggesting that compact document representations are a fruitful strategy for scaling-up retrieval systems.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC 2003, the Database and Information System Lab (DBIS) at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) participate in the robust track, which is a traditional ad hoc retrieval task. The emphasis is based on average effectiveness as well as individual topic effectiveness. Noun phrases in the query are identified and classified into 4 types: proper names, dictionary phrases, simple phrases and complex phrases. A document has a phrase if all content words in a phrase are within a window of a certain size. The window sizes for different types of phrases are different. We consider phrases to be more important than individual terms. As a consequence, documents in response to a query are ranked with matching phrases given a higher priority. WordNet is used to disambiguate word senses and bring in useful synonyms and hyponyms once the correct senses of the words in a query have been identified. The usual pseudo-feedback process is modified so that the documents are also ranked according to phrase and word similarities with phrase matching having a higher priority. Five runs which use either title or title and description have been submitted.

	Hummingbird participated in 4 tasks of TREC 2003: the ad hoc task of the Robust Retrieval Track (find at least one relevant document in the first 10 rows from 1.9GB of news and government data), the navigational task of the Web Track (find the home or named page in 1.2 million pages (18GB) from the .GOV domain), the topic distillation task of the Web Track (find key resources for topics in the first 10 rows from home pages of .GOV), and the primary task of the Genomics Track (find all records focusing on the named gene in 1.1GB of MEDLINE data). In the ad hoc task, SearchServer found a relevant document in the first 10 rows for 48 of the 50 new short (Title-only) topics. In the navigational task, SearchServer returned the home or named page in the first 10 rows for more than 75% of the 300 queries. In the distillation task, a SearchServer run found the most key resources in the first 10 rows of the submitted runs from 23 groups.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Ranking functions are instrumental for the success of an information retrieval (search engine) system. However nearly all existing ranking functions are manually designed based on experience, observations and probabilistic theories. This paper tested a novel ranking function discovery technique proposed in [Fan 2003a, Fan2003b] - ARRANGER (Automatic geneRation of RANking functions by GEnetic pRogramming), which uses Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically learn the “best” ranking function, for the robust retrieval task. Ranking function discovery is essentially an optimization problem. As the search space here is not a coordinate system, most of the traditional optimization algorithms could not work. However, this ranking discovery problem could be easily tackled by ARRANGER. In our evaluations on 150 queries from the ad-hoc track of TREC 6, 7, and 8, the performance of our system (in average precision) was improved by nearly 16%, after replacing Okapi BM25 function with a function automatically discovered by ARRANGER. By applying pseudo-relevance feedback and ranking fusion on newly discovered functions, we improved the retrieval performance by up to 30%. The results of our experiments showed that our ranking function discovery technique - ARRANGER - is very effective in discovering high-performing ranking functions.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC 2003 the MultiText Project focused its efforts on the Genomics and Robust tracks. We also submitted passage-retrieval runs for the QA track. For the Genomics Track primary task, we used an amalgamation of retrieval and query expansion techniques, including tiering, term re-writing and pseudo-relevance feedback. For the Robust Track, we examined the impact of pseudo-relevance feedback on retrieval effectiveness under the new robustness measures. All of our TREC runs were generated by the MultiText System, a collection of tools and techniques for information retrieval, question answering and structured text search. The MultiText Project at the University of Waterloo has been developing this system since 1993 and has participated in TREC annually since TREC-4 in 1995. In the next section, we briefly review the retrieval methods used in our TREC 2003 runs. Depending on the track, various combinations of these methods were used to generate our runs. The remaining sections describe our activities for the individual tracks, with the bulk of the report covering our Genomics Track results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we report our experiments in the TREC 2003 Genomics Track and the Robust Track. A common theme that we explored is the robustness of a basic language modeling retrieval approach. We examine several aspects of robustness, including robustness in handling different types of queries, different types of documents, and op- timizing performance for difficult topics. Our basic re- trieval method is the KL-divergence retrieval model with the two-stage smoothing method plus a mixture model feedback method. In the Genomics IR track, we propose a new method for modeling semi-structured queries using language models, which is shown to be more robust and effective than the regular query model in handling gene queries. In the Robust track, we experimented with two heuristic approaches to improve the robustness in using language models for pseudo feedback.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This is the second time that Tsinghua University Information Retrieval Group (THUIR) participates in TREC. In this year, we took part in four tracks: novelty, robust, web and HARD, describing in following sections, respectively. A new IR system named TMiner has been built on which all experiments have been performed. In the system, Primary Feature Model (PFM)[1] has been proposed and combined with BM2500 term weighting [2] , which led to encouraging results. Word-pair searching has also been performed and improves system precision. Both approaches are described in robust experiments (section 2), and they were also used in web track experiments.
