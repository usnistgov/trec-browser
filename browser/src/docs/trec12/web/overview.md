The TREC 2003 web track consisted of both a non-interactive stream and an interactive stream. Both streams worked with the .GOV test collection. The non-interactive stream continued an investigation into the importance of homepages in Web ranking, via both a Topic Distillation task and a Navigational task. In the topic distillation task, systems were expected to return a list of the homepages of sites relevant to each of a series of broad queries. This differs from previous homepage experiments in that queries may have multiple correct answers. The navigational task required systems to return a particular desired web page as early as possible in the ranking in response to queries. In half of the queries, the target answer was the homepage of a site and the query was derived from the name of the site (Homepage finding) while in the other half, the target answers were not homepages and the queries were derived from the name of the page (Named page finding). The two types of query were arbitrarily mixed and not identified. The interactive stream focused on human participation in a topic distillation task over the .GOV collection. Studies conducted by the two participating groups compared a search engine using automatic topic distillation features with the same engine with those features disabled in order to determine whether the automatic topic distillation features assisted the users in the performance of their tasks and whether humans could achieve better results than the automatic system.
