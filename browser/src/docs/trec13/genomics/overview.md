The TREC 2004 Genomics Track consisted of two tasks. The first task was a standard ad hoc retrieval task using topics obtained from real biomedical research scientists and documents from a large subset of the MEDLINE bibliographic database. The second task focused on categorization of full-text documents, simulating the task of curators of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) system and consisting of three subtasks. One subtask focused on the triage of articles likely to have experimental evidence warranting the assignment of GO terms, while the other two subtasks focused on the assignment of the three top-level GO categories.
