The goal of the Robust track is to improve the consistency of retrieval technology by focusing on poorly performing topics. In addition, the track brings back a classic, ad hoc retrieval task in TREC that provides a natural home for new participants. An ad hoc task in TREC investigates the performance of systems that search a static set of documents using previously-unseen topics. For each topic, participants create a query and submit a ranking of the top 1000 documents for that topic.
