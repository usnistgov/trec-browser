The goal of the Terabyte Track is to develop an evaluation methodology for terabyte-scale document collections. This year's track uses a 426GB collection of Web data from the .gov domain. While this collection is less than a full terabyte in size, it is considerably larger than the collections used in previous TREC tracks. In future years, we plan to expand the collection using data from other sources.
