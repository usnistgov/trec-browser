This year's main experiment involved processing a mixed query stream, with an even mix of each query type studied in TREC-2003: 75 homepage finding queries, 75 named page finding queries and 75 topic distillation queries. The goal was to find ranking approaches which work well over the 225 queries, without access to query type labels.
