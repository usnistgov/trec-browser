The goal of the enterprise track is to conduct experiments with enterprise data — intranet pages, email archives, document repositories — that reflect the experiences of users in real organisations, such that for example, an email ranking technique that is effective here would be a good choice for deployment in a real multi-user email search application. This involves both understanding user needs in enterprise search and development of appropriate IR techniques.
