The goal of the Robust track is to improve the consistency of retrieval technology by focusing on poorly performing topics. This year, the track will investigate the effectiveness obtainable on a new document set for topics that are known to be difficult on a separate document set. For each topic, participants create a query and submit a ranking of the top 1000 documents for that topic.
