The primary goal of the Terabyte Track is to develop an evaluation methodology for terabyte-scale document collections. In addition, we are interested in efficiency and scalability issues, which can be studied more easily in the context of a larger collection. Again this year, we are using a 426GB collection of Web data from the gov domain for all tasks. While this collection is less than a full terabyte in size, it is considerably larger than the collections used in previous TREC tracks. In future years, we hope to expand the collection using data from other sources.
