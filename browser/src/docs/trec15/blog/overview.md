The Blog track began this year, with the aim to explore the information seeking behaviour in the blogosphere. For this purpose, a new large-scale test collection, namely the TREC Blog06 collection, has been created. In the first pilot run of the track in 2006, we had two tasks, a main task (opinion retrieval) and an open task. The opinion retrieval task focuses on a specific aspect of blogs: the opinionated nature of many blogs. The second task was introduced to allow participants the opportunity to influence the determination of a suitable second task (for 2007) on other aspects of blogs, such as the temporal/event-related nature of many blogs, or the severity of spam in the blogosphere.
