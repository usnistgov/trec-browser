The enterprise track began in TREC 2005 as the successor to the web track, and this is reflected in the tasks and measures. While the track takes much of its inspiration from the web track, the foci are on search at the enterprise scale, incorporating non-web data and discovering relationships between entities in the organization. As a result, we have created the first test collections for multi-user email search and expert finding.
