The goal of the Legal Track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) is to assess the ability of information retrieval techniques to meet the needs of the legal profession for tools and methods capable of helping with the retrieval of electronic business records, principally for use as evidence in civil litigation. In the USA, this problem is referred to as e-discovery. Like all TREC tracks, the Legal Track seeks to foster the development of a research community by providing a venue for shared development of evaluation resources (test collections) and baseline results to which future results can be compared.
