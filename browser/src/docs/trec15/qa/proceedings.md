??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The TREC 2006 question answering (QA) track contained two tasks: the main task and the complex, interactive question answering (ciQA) task. As in 2005, the main task consisted of series of factoid, list, and “Other” questions organized around a set of targets; in contrast to previous years, the evaluation of factoid and list responses distinguished between answers that were globally correct (with respect to the document collection), and those that were only locally correct (with respect to the supporting document). The ciQA task provided a framework for participants to investigate interaction in the context of complex information needs, and was a blend of the TREC 2005 QA relationship task and the TREC 2005 HARD track. Multiple assessors were used to judge the importance of information nuggets used to evaluate the responses to ciQA and “Other” questions, resulting in an evaluation that is more stable and discriminative than one that uses only a single assessor to judge nugget importance.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The ciqa track investigates the role of interaction in answering complex questions: questions that relate two or more entities by some specified relationship. In our submission to the first ciqa track we were interested in the interplay between groups of variables: variables describing the question creators, the questions asked and the presentation of answers to the questions. We used two interaction forms - html questionnaires completed before answer assessment - to gain contextual information from the answer assessors to better understand what factors influence assessors when judging retrieved answers to complex questions. Our results indicate the importance of understanding the assessor's personal relationship to the question - their existing topical knowledge for example - and also the presentation of the answers - contextual information about the answer to aid in the assessment of the answer.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This is the first attempt of Artificial Intelligence Division of TrulyIntelligent Technologies Pvt. Ltd. at the TREC2006 Question Answering track. As any Question Answering (QA) system typically involves Question Analysis, Document Retrieval, Answer Extraction and Answer Ranking and this being our first attempt and with certain constraints of time and resources, we developed some modules of our QA system in line with already existing approaches, for example document retrieval, pattern based answer extraction and web boosting. But there are areas where we tried our ideas and got quite encouraging results particularly, Question Analysis, Constraint based Answer Extraction and Answer Ranking which are described in this paper.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This report describes the system developed at the University of Rome “La Sapienza” for the TREC-2006 question answering evaluation exercise. The backbone of this QA system is linguistically-principled: Combinatory Categorial Grammar is used to generate syntactic analyses of questions and potential answer snippets, and Discourse Representation Theory is employed as formalism to match the meanings of questions and answers. The key idea of the La Sapienza system is to use semantics to prune answer candidates, thereby exploiting lexical resources such as WordNet and Nom- Lex to facilitate the selection of answers. The system performed reasonably well at TREC-2006: in the per-series evaluation it performed slightly above the median accuracy score of all participating systems.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Qanda is MITRE's TREC-style question answering system. In recent years, we have been able to apply only a small effort to the TREC QA activity, approximately six person-weeks this year. (Accordingly, much of this discussion is plagiarized from prior system descriptions.) We made a number of small improvements to the system this year, including expanding our use of Wordnet. The system's information retrieval wrapper now performs iterative query relaxation in order to improve document retrieval. We also experimented with an ad hoc means of “boosting” the maximum entropy model used to score candidate answers in order to improve its ranking ability.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this article I substantiate my position that a human being is a point of accumulation - that is, an object. And based on this assumption I provide a foundation for my ontological justification of Differential Linguistics: I then introduce the understanding that 'becoming better and the best' is what motivates an object to movement (and change). Then I link this position with Egoism, and to achieve an understanding of what Egoism is I find it necessary to bring in the foundations I had previously elaborated for the New Mechanics and Differential Philosophy of Cynicism. Then I affirm that an object seeks information in order to 'become better and the best', and I show that information is required egoistically and that the finding of information is made possible by asking two classes of questions: factoid and definition questions.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	As a natural language processing group (NLP) our original approach to question answering was linguistically motivated culminating in the development of the QA-LaSIE system (Humphreys et al., 1999). In its original form QA-LaSIE would only propose answers which were linked via syntactic/semantic relations to the information missing from the question (for example “Who released the Internet worm?” is missing a person). While the answers proposed by the system were often correct, the system was frequently unable to suggest any answer. The next version of the system loosened the requirement for a link between question and answer which improved performance (Scott and Gaizauskas, 2000). There are still a number of open questions from the development of the QA-LaSIE system: does the use of parsing and discourse interpretation to determine links between questions and proposed answers result in better performance than simpler systems which adopt a shallower approach? Is it simply that the performance of our parser is below the level at which it could contribute to question answering? Are there questions which can only be answered using deep linguistic techniques? With the continued development of a second QA system at Sheffield which uses shallower techniques (Gaizauskas et al., 2005) we believe that we are now in a position to investigate these and related questions. Our entries to the 2006 TREC QA evaluation are designed to help us answer some of these questions and to investigate further the possible benefits of linguistic processing over shallower techniques. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Firstly the framework in which our systems are developed is described in section 2 along with the QA system components. Section 3 describes the configurations and aims of our evaluation runs. Section 4 discusses the official evaluation results of our submitted runs in relation to the research questions outlined above.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes the architecture and implementation of Tianwang QA system2006, which works for the TREC QA Main task this year. The main improvement is: 1. add one well founded knowledge source from Web - Wikipedia, and employ some natural language processing technologies to extract high quality answers; 2. design and implement a new translation algorithm in query generation. The results show that fine organized knowledge source is effective in answering all three types of questions. And such query generation algorithm can be benefit from both Frequent Asked Questions on Web and past TREC QA data.

	CHAUCER is a Q/A system developed for (a) combining several strategies for modeling the target of a series of questions and (b) optimizing the extraction of answers. Targets were modeled by (1) topic signatures; (2) semantic types; (3) lexico-semantic patterns; (4) frame dependencies; and (5) predictive questions. Several strategies for answer extraction were also tried. The best-performing strategy was based on the use of textual entailment.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The University of Washington's U WCLM AQA is an open-architecture Question Answering system, built around open source tools unified into one system design using customized enhancements. The goal was to develop an end-to-end QA system that could be easily modified by switching out tools as needed. Central to the system is Lucene, which we use for document retrieval. Various other tools are used, such the GoogleAPI for web boosting, fnTBL Chunker for text chunking, Lingua::Stem for stemming, Lingpipe for Named Entity Recognition, etc. We also developed several in-house evaluation tools for gauging our progress at each major milestone (e.g., document classification, document retrieval, passage retrieval, etc.) and statistical classifiers were developed that we use for various classification tasks.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We describe experiments carried out at the University of Edinburgh for our TREC 2006 QA participation. Our main effort was to develop an approach to QA that is based on frame semantics. Two algorithms were implemented to this end, building on the lexical resources FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet. The first algorithm uses the resources to generate potential answer templates to a given question, which are then used to pose exact, quoted queries to a web search engine and confirm which of the results contain an actual answer to the question. The second algorithm bases search queries on key words only, but it can recognize answers in a wider range of syntactic variants in its candidate sentence analysis stage. We discuss both approaches when applied to each of the resources and a combination of these. We also describe how-in a later step-the found answer candidates are mapped to the AQUAINT corpus and how we answered other questions.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	MIT CSAIL's entries for the TREC Question Answering track (Voorhees, 2006) explored the effects of new document retrieval and duplicate removal strategies for 'list' and 'other' questions, established a baseline for other systems in the interactive task, and focused on question analysis and paraphrasing, rather than incorporation of external knowledge, in the factoid task. Many of the individual subsystems are largely unchanged from last year. We found that document retrieval strategy has an influence on performance in the different kinds of tasks later in the pipeline. Our other changes from last year did not immediately yield clear lessons. We present a question analysis data set and interannotator agreement indicators for the ciQA task that we hope will spur further evaluation.

	We present a question-answering system Jellyfish. Our approach is based on marking and matching steps that are implemented using the methodology of cascaded regular-expression rewriting. We present the system architecture and evaluate the system using the TREC 2004, 2005, and 2006 datasets. TREC 2004 was used as a training dataset, while TREC 2005 and TREC 2006 were used as testing dataset. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated in the results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we describe the system we used for the TREC Question Answering Track. For factoid and list questions two different approaches were exploited: A redundancy-based approach using a modified version of aranea and a parse-tree based unifier. The modified version of aranea essentially uses Google snippets for extracting answers and then projects them to aquaint. The parse-tree based unifier is a linguistic-based approach that chunks candidate sentences syntactically and uses a heuristic measure to compute the similarity of each chunk in a candidate to its counterpart in the question. To answer other types of questions, our system extracts from Wikipedia articles a list of interest-marking terms related to the topic and uses them to extract and score sentences from the aquaint document collection using various interest-marking triggers. We submitted 3 runs using different variations of the system. In the factoid run, the average of our 3 runs is 0.202, for the list, we achieved an average of 0.084, and for the “Other”, we achieved an average F-score of 0.192.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The characteristics of the ciQA Track namely the short templated queries and the scope for user interaction were the motivating factors for our interest in participating in the track. Templated queries represent a new paradigm of information-seeking more suited for specialized tasks. While work has been done in document retrieval for templated queries as part of the Global Autonomous Language Exploitation1 (GALE) program, the retrieval of snippets of information in lieu of documents was an interesting challenge. We also utilized the opportunity to try a suite of minimally interactive techniques, some of which helped and some did not. We believe we have a reasonable understanding of why some approaches worked while other failed, and contend that more experimentation and analysis is necessary to tease out various interaction effects between the suite of approaches we tried.

	Two research directions are to be explored in realizing our group's TREC QA system in 2006. The first one is to investigate the possibilities of applying linguistically sophisticated grammatical framework in tackling the real-world natural language processing task such as question answering. The other is to exploit the possible world's entities and relations as described in online encyclopedia in adding redundancy and hidden relations as those contained in the TREC corpus where the entities and relations are only implicitly mentioned and related. Our focus is on the factoid and list question as these two types of questions benefit greatly from our proposed method. We do include an experimental component in handling the ”other” question type.

This year there have been several improvements in the AnswerFinder system, although most of them in the implementation sphere. The actual functionality used this year is almost exactly the same as last year, but many bugs are fixed and the efficiency of the system has improved much. This allows for more extensive parameter tuning. Here we will also present an error analysis of the current AnswerFinder system.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Our participation in the TREC 2006 QA task is the first step on the way of developing a new and improved DIOGENE system. The leading principles of this re-engineering activity are: i) to create a modular architecture, based on a pipeline of modules which share common I/O formats, open to the insertion/substitution of new components; ii) to allow for the capability of configuring the settings of the different modules with external configuration files; iii) to provide the capability of performing fine-grained evaluation cycles over the individual processing modules which compose a QA system. Another long-term objective of our work on QA, is to make the core components of the system freely available to the QA community for research purposes. This paper overviews the work done up to date to achieve these objectives, focusing on the description of a prototype module designed to handle the anaphoric questions often contained into TREC QA series. Preliminar evaluation results of the new module are presented, together with those achieved by DIOGENE at TREC 2006.

	The Ephyra QA system has been developed as a flexible open-domain QA framework. This framework allows us to combine several techniques for question analysis and answer extraction and to incorporate multiple knowledge bases to best fit the requirements of the TREC QA track, in which we participated this year for the first time. The techniques used include pattern learning and matching, answer type analysis and redundancy elimination through filters. In this paper, we give an overview of the Ephyra system as used within TREC 2006 and analyze the system's performance in the QA track.

	The QACTIS system has been tested in previous years at the TREC Question Answering Evaluations. This paper describes new enhancements to the system specific to TREC-2006, including basic improvements and thresholding experiments, filtered and Internet-supported pseudo-relevance feedback for information retrieval, and emerging statistics-driven question-answering. For contrast, we also compare our TREC-2006 system performance to that of our top systems from TREC-2004 and TREC-2005 applied to this year's data. Lastly, we analyze evaluator-declared unsupportedness of factoids and nugget decisions of “other” questions to understand major negative changes in performance for these categories over last year.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We present our new statistically-inspired open-domain Q&A research system that allows to carry out a wide range of experiments easily and flexibly by modifying a central file containing an experimental “recipe” that controls the activation and parameter selection of a range of widely-used and custom-built components. Based on this, we report our experiments for the TREC 2006 question answering track, where we used a cascade of LM-based document retrieval, LM-based sentence extraction, MaxEnt-based answer extraction over a dependency relation representation followed by a fusion process that uses linear interpolation to integrate evidence from various data streams to detect answers to factoid questions more accurately than the median of all participants.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Diggery is a research and software project, investigating the extraction of concepts from well-written documents, with the idea of automating factoid search. The project is in its early to middle phases, and all information presented herein should be taken in light that this research is based on young software using new algorithms. In January 2006, after significant tuning, the software could answer a few simple questions from small texts. Six months later, in July 2006, the first real exercise of the software on a non-trivially sized corpora was made for the TREC QA submission, and the software answered a few questions correctly. For this submission, only factoid questions were attempted.

	In this paper we describe our participation in the Complex Interactive Question Answering (ciQA) task of the QA track. We investigated the use of lexical cohesive ties (called lexical bonds) between sentences containing different question entities in finding information about relationships between these entities. We also investigated the role of clarification forms in assisting the system in finding answers to complex questions. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we present our approach to calculating lexical bonds between sentences containing different entities, section 3 contains the detailed description of our systems, in section 4 we present the results, and section 5 contains discussions.

	In this paper we describe Tokyo Institute of Technology's speech group's second attempt at the TREC2006 question answering (QA) track. Keeping the same theoretical QA model as for the TREC2005 task this year we investigated combinations of variations of models focusing once again on the factoid QA task. An experimental run combining translated answers from separate English, French and Spanish systems proved inconclusive. However, our best combination of all component models gave us a factoid performance of 25.1% (placing us 9th and well above the median of the 30 participating systems of 18.6%) and an overall performance including the results from the list and other question tasks of 11.6% (which was somewhat below the median of 13.4%).

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year, we made changes to the pas- sage/sentence retrieval component of ILQUA in handling factoid and list questions. All the other components remain same. ILQUA is an IE-driven QA system. To answer “Factoid” and “List” questions, we apply our answer extraction methods on NE-tagged passages or sentences. The answer extraction methods adopted here are surface text pattern matching, n-gram proximity search, and syntactic dependency matching. Although surface text pattern matching has been applied in some previous TREC QA systems, the patterns used in ILQUA are better since they are automatically generated by a supervised learning system and represented in a format of regular expressions which contain multiple question terms. In addition to surface pattern matching, we also adopt n-gram proximity search and syntactic dependency matching. N-grams of question terms are matched around every named entity in the candidate sentences or passages and a list of named entities are generated as answer candidate. These named entities then go through a multi-level syntactic dependency matching component until a final answer is generated. To answer “Other” questions, we parsed the answer sentences of “Other” questions in previous main task and built syntactic patterns combined with semantic features. These patterns are later applied to the parsed candidate sentences to extract answers of “Other” questions. Figure 1 shows the diagram of the ILQUA architecture.

	This is the second time that our group takes part in the QA track of TREC. We developed a question-answering system, named InsunQA06, based on our Insun05QA system, and with InsunQA06 we participated in the Main Task, which submitted answers to three types of questions: factoid questions, list questions and others questions. The structure of InsunQA06 is similar with the structure of Insun05QA. Towards Insun05QA, the main difference of InsunQA06 is that new methods are developed and used in answer extraction module, for factoid and “others” questions. And external knowledge such as knowledge from Internet plays more important role in answer extraction. Besides that, we accomplished our documents retrieval module based on Indri, instead of SMART in InsunQA06. In Section 2, the structure of our InsunQA06 system will be describe, the details of the new methods that we adopted to process the factoid, and “others” questions will separately be described in Section 3, and our results in TREC2006 will be presented in Section 4.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this year's QA Track, we participant in the main task and do not take part in the ciQA task. The main task is essentially the same as the single task from 2004, in that the test set consists of a set of question series where each series asks for information regarding a particular target. In order to better answer the questions in the series, we try to improve our anaphora resolution within question series. For factoid questions, we use the system that submits the RUN-A in TREC 2005[Wu et al. 2005]. Therefore we won't describe the factoid system in this paper. For list questions, we get a lot of improvements, the most important of which are answer type classification, document searching, answer ranking and answer filtering. For definition question, we still focus on utilizing the existing definitions in the Web knowledge bases. And also applied the method of relative terms extraction to extract reliable information associated with target for getting web definition directly by question target is becoming a bottleneck. In the following, Section 2 will describe question series anaphora resolution. Section 3,and 4 will describe our algorithms for list and definition questions separately. Section 5 will present our results in TREC 2006.
