The goal of the Blog track is to explore the information seeking behaviour in the blogosphere. It aims to create the required infrastructure to facilitate research into the blogosphere and to study retrieval from blogs and other related applied tasks. The track was introduced in 2006 with a main opinion finding task and an open task, which allowed participants the opportunity to influence the determination of a suitable second task for 2007 on other aspects of blogs besides their opinionated nature.
