The goal of the enterprise track is to conduct experiments with enterprise data that reflect the experiences of users in real organizations. This year, the track has introduced a new corpus with the goal to be more representative of real-world enterprise search, by involving actual members of the organization in the topic development process, performing their real work tasks.
