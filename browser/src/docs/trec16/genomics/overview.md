The TREC 2007 Genomics Track employed an entity-based question-answering task. Runs were required to nominate passages of text from a collection of full-text biomedical journal articles to answer the topic questions. Systems were assessed not only for the relevance of passages retrieved, but also how many aspects (entities) of the topic were covered and how many relevant documents were retrieved. We also classified the features of runs to explore which ones were associated with better performance, although the diversity of approaches and the quality of their reporting prevented definitive conclusions from being drawn.
