TREC 2007 was the second year of the Legal Track, which focuses on evaluation of search technology for discovery of electronically stored information in litigation and regulatory settings. The track included three tasks: Ad Hoc (i.e., single-pass automatic) search, Relevance Feedback (two-pass search in a controlled setting with some relevant and nonrelevant documents manually marked after the first pass) and Interactive (in which real users could iteratively refine their queries and/or engage in multi-pass relevance feedback). This paper describes the design of the three tasks and analyzes the results.
