{==

The goal of this track is to run a retrieval task similar to standard ad-hoc retrieval, but to evaluate large numbers of queries incompletely, rather than a small number more completely.   Participants will run 10,000 queries and a random 1,000 or so will be evaluated. The corpus is the terabyte track's GOV2 corpus of roughly 25,000,000 .gov web pages, amounting to just under half a terabyte of data.
