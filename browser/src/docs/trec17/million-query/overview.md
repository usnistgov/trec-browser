{==

The Million Query (1MQ) track ran for the second time in TREC 2008. The track is designed to serve two purposes: first, it is an exploration of ad-hoc retrieval over a large set of queries and a large collection of documents; second, it investigates questions of system evaluation, in particular whether it is better to evaluate using many shallow judgments or fewer thorough judgments.
