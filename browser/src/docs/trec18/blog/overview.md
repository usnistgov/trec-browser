The Blog track explores the information seeking behaviour in the blogosphere. Thus far, since its inception in 2006, the Blog track addressed two main search tasks based on the analysis of a commercial blog search engine: the opinion-finding task (i.e. “What do people think about X?”) and the blog distillation task (i.e. “Find me a blog with a principal, recurring interest in X.”)
