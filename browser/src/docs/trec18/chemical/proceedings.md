	TREC 2009 was the first year of the Chemical IR Track, which focuses on evaluation of search techniques for discovery of digitally stored information on chemical patents and academic journal articles. The track included two tasks: Prior Art (PA) and Technical Survey (TS) tasks. This paper describes how we designed the two tasks and presents the official results of eight participating groups.

	We participated in the technology survey and prior art search subtasks of the TREC 2009 Chemical IR Track. This paper describes the methods developed for these two tasks. For the technology survey task, we propose a method that constructs highly structured queries to do retrieval on different fields of chemical patents and documents in a weighted way. The proposed method i) enriches these structured queries with synonyms of the chemicals that have been identified, and ii) uses simple entity recognition to extract information for increasing or decreasing weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list. For prior art search task; we propose an automated query generation method that uses all title words, and selects sets of terms from the claims, abstract and description fields of query patents to transform a query patent into a search query. From the selected terms, chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are included from PubChem. Then structured queries are formed to do retrieval over different fields of documents with different weights. Furthermore a post-processing step is also proposed that i) filters out some of the retrieved documents from the ranked list because of date constraints and ii) utilizes the IPC similarities between query patent and its retrieved patents to re-rank the retrieved documents. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in both tasks.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The goal of the first TREC Chemical track was to retrieve documents relevant to a given patent query, within a large collection of patents in chemistry. Regarding this objective, for the Prior Art subtask, our runs performed significantly better that runs submitted by other participating teams. Baseline retrieval methods achieved relatively poor performances (Mean Average Precision = 0.067). Query expansion, driven my chemical named entity recognition resulted in some modest improvement (+2 to 3%). Filtering based on IPC codes did not result in any significant improvement. A re-ranking strategy, based on claims only improved MAP by about 3%. The most effective gain was obtained by using patent citation patterns. Somehow similar to feed-back but restricted to citations, we used patents cited in the retrieved patents in order to boost the retrieval status value of the baseline run. This strategy led to a remarkable improvement (MAP 0.18, +168 %). Nevertheless, as official topics were sampled from the collection disregarding their creation date, our strategy happened to exploit citations of patents which were patented after the topic itself. From a user perspective, such a setting is questionable. We think that future TREC-CHEM competitions should address this issue by using patents filed as recently as possible.

	This paper reports on the work that has been conducted by Fraunhofer SCAI for Trec Chemistry (Trec-Chem) track 2009. The team of Fraunhofer SCAI participated in two tasks, namely Technology Survey and Prior Art Search. The core of the framework is an index of 1.2 million chemical patents provided as a data set by Trec. For the technology survey, three runs were submitted based on semantic dictionaries and noun phrases. For the prior art search task, several fields were introduced into the index that contained normalized noun phrases, biomedical as well as chemical entities. Altogether, 36 runs were submitted for this task that were based on automatic querying with tokens, noun phrases and entities along with different search strategies.

	This paper presents the DUTIR submission to TREC 2009 Chemical IR Track. This track included two tasks: Prior Art (PA) and Technical Survey (TS) tasks. We present a series of experiments on two text retrieval models, BM25 and Language Model for IR (LMIR). For Prior Art task, we focused on formulating the queries from the query patents and date filtering. Moreover, some traditional search techniques are used for Technical Survey task.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For the TREC-2009 Chemical IR Track, we explore development of a distributed information retrieval system based on a dimensional data model. The indexing model supports named entity identification and aggregation of term statistics at multiple levels of patent structure including individual words, sentences, claims, descriptions, abstracts, and titles. The system was deployed across 15 Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances and 15 Elastic Block Storage (EBS) database shards to support efficient indexing and query processing of the relatively large index generated from indexing each individual word (sans stop words) in the 100G+ collection of chemical patent documents. The query processing algorithm for technology survey search and prior art search uses information extraction techniques and locally aggregated term statistics to help disambiguate candidate entities and terms in context. Query processing for prior art search automatically generates a structured query based on the relative distinctiveness of individual terms and candidate entity phrases from the query patent's claims, abstract, and title sections. For both the technology survey and prior art search, we evaluated several probabilistic retrieval functions for integrating statistics of retrieved named entities with term statistics at multiple levels of document structure to identify relevant patents.

#### Formulating Simple Structured Queries Using Temporal and Distributional  Cues in Patents

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Patent prior art retrieval aims to find related publications, especially patents, which may invalidate the patent. The task exhibits its own characteristic because of the possible use of a whole patent as a query. This work focuses on the use of date fields and content fields of the query patent to formulate effective structured queries. Retrieval is performed on the collection of patents which also share the same structure as the query patent, mainly priority dates, application date, publication date and content fields. Unsurprisingly, results show that filtering using date information improves retrieval significantly. However, results also show that a careful choice of the date filter is important, given the multiple date fields existent in a patent. The actual ranking query is constructed based on word distributions of title, claims and content fields of the query patent. The overall MAP of this citation finding task is still in the lower 0.1 range. An error analysis focusing on the lower performing topics finds that the citation finding task (given publication recommend citations, which is a very similar setup as this year's prior art evaluation) can be very different from the prior art task (finding patents that invalidates the query patent). It raises the concern that just the citations included in query patents can be a biased and incomplete set of relevance judgements for the prior art task.

	Our chemical experiments mainly focus on addressing three major problems in two chemical information retrieval tasks, Technology Survey (TS) task and Prior Art (PA) task. The three problems are: (1) how to deal with chemical terminology synonyms? (2) how to deal with chemical terminology abbreviation? (3) how to deal with long queries in Prior Art (PA) task? In particular, we propose a query expansion algorithm for TS task and a keyword-selection algorithm for PA task. The Mean Average Precision (MAP) for our TS task run âyork09ca07â using Algorithm 1 was 0.2519 and for our PA task run âyork09caPA01â using Algorithm 2 was 0.0566. The evaluation results show that both algorithms are effective for improving retrieval performance.
