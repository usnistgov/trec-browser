The Million Query Track ran for the third time in 2009. The track is designed to serve two purposes: first, it is an exploration of ad hoc retrieval over a large set of queries and a large collection of documents; second, it investigates questions of system evaluation, in particular whether it is better to evaluate using many queries judged shallowly or fewer queries judged thoroughly
