TREC 2010 was the fifth year of the Legal Track, which focuses on evaluation of search technology for discovery of electronically stored information in litigation and regulatory settings. The TREC 2010 Legal Track consisted of two distinct tasks: the Learning task, in which participants were required to estimate the probability of relevance for each document in a large collection, given a seed set of documents, each coded as responsive or non-responsive; and the Interactive task, in which participants were required to identify all relevant documents using a human-in-the-loop process.
