# Overview - Relevance Feedback 2010

[`Proceedings`](./proceedings.md) | [`Data`](./data.md) | [`Runs`](./runs.md) | [`Participants`](./participants.md)

{==

This is the third year of the TREC relevance feedback track. The first year concentrated on the RF algorithm itself. All participants were given the same sets of judged docs, and used their own algorithms to retrieve a new set of docs. In the second year, the concentration shifted to finding good sets of docs to base their retrieval on. Each participant submitted one or two sets of 5 docs for each topic, and 3-5 other participants ran with those docs, thus getting a nonsystem dependent score on how good those docs were.
