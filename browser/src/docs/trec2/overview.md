**Donna Harman, Overview of the Second Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-2):**

The second TREC conference occurred in August of 1993, less than 10 months after the first conference. In addition to 22 of the TREC-l groups, nine new groups took part. bringing the total number of participating groups to 31. Many of the original TREC-1 groups were able to "complete" their system rebuilding and tuning, and in general the TREC-2 results show significant improvements over the TREC-1 results.
