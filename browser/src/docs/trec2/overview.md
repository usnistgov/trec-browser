# Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 1993

{==

TREC is designed to encourage research in information retrieval using large data collections. Two types of retrieval are being examined -- retrieval using an adhoc query such as a researcher might use in a library environment, and retrieval using a 'routing' query such as a profile to filter some incoming document stream.
