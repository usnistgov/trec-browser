{==

The third year of the Chemical IR evaluation track benefitted from the support of many more people interested in the domain, as shown by the number of co-authors of this overview paper. We continued the two tasks we had before, and introduced a new task focused on chemical image recognition. The objective is to gradually move towards systems really useful to the practitioners, and in chemistry, this involves both text and images.
