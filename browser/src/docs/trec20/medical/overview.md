The search task within the TREC 2011 Medical Records track  was an ad hoc search task that modeled the clinical task of finding cohorts for comparative effectiveness research. The document set used in the track was based on a set of de-identified clinical reports made available by the University of Pittsburgh's BLULab NLP Repository.  This document set is not available to non-participants.   There is a many-to-one mapping between reports and ''visits'', where a visit is an individual patient's single stay at a hospital.  The visit was used as the unit of retrieval in the track (so a document for the purposes of the track was the union of the content in all records mapped to that visit).
