The Microblog track examines search tasks and evaluation methodologies for information seeking behaviours in microblogging environments such as Twitter. It was first introduced in 2011, addressing a real-time adhoc search task, whereby the user wishes to see the most recent but relevant information to the query. In particular, systems should respond to a query by providing a list of relevant tweets ordered from newest to oldest, starting from the time the query was issued.
