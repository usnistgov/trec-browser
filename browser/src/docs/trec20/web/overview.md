The TREC Web Track explores and evaluates Web retrieval technology over large collections of Web data. In its current incarnation, the Web Track has been active since TREC 2009, where it included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task. The goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. For TREC 2010 the track introduced a new Web spam task and Web-style, six-level relevance assessment for the adhoc task. For TREC 2011, as recommended by participants at the track planning session held during TREC 2010, we dropped the spam task but continued the other tasks essentially unchanged. As we did for TREC 2009 and TREC 2010, we based our TREC 2011 experiments on the billion-page ClueWeb09 collection created by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University
