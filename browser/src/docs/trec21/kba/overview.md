The Knowledge Base Acceleration track in TREC 2012 focused on a single task: filter a time-ordered corpus for documents that are highly relevant to a predefined list of entities. KBA differs from previous filtering evaluations in two primary ways: the stream corpus is >100x larger than previous filtering collections, and the use of entities as topics enables systems to incorporate structured knowledge bases (KB), such as Wikipedia, as external data sources. A successful KBA system must do more than resolve the meaning of entity mentions by linking documents to the KB: it must also distinguish centrally relevant documents that are worth citing in the entityâ€™s WP article. This combines thinking from natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR).
