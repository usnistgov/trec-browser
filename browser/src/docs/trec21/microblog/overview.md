The Microblog track examines search tasks and evaluation methodologies for information seeking behaviours in microblogging environments such as Twitter. It was first introduced in 2011, addressing a real-time adhoc search task, whereby the user wishes to see the most recent relevant information to the query. In 2012, the realtime adhoc task was changed slightly, and a new filtering task was added. The filtering task models a standing query where the user wishes to see relevant tweets as they are posted.
