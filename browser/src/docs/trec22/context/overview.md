{==

The contextual suggestion track investigates search techniques for complex information needs that are highly dependent on context and user interests. For example, imagine an information retrieval researcher with a November evening to spend in Gaithersburg, Maryland. A contextual suggestion system might recommend a beer at the Dogfish Head Alehouse, dinner at the Flaming Pit, or even a trip into Washington on the metro to see the National Mall. The primary goal of this track is to develop evaluation methodologies for such systems.
