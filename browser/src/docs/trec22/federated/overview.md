The TREC Federated Web Search track is intended to promote research related to federated search in a realistic web setting, and hereto provides a large data collection gathered from a series of online search engines. This overview paper discusses the results of the first edition of the track, FedWeb 2013. The focus was on basic challenges in federated search: (1) resource selection, and (2) results merging. After an overview of the provided data collection and the relevance judgments for the test topics, the participantsâ€™ individual approaches and results on both tasks are discussed. Promising research directions and an outlook on the 2014 edition of the track are provided as well.
