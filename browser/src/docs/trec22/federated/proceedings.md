??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The TREC Federated Web Search track is intended to promote research related to federated search in a realistic web setting, and hereto provides a large data collection gathered from a series of online search engines. This overview paper discusses the results of the first edition of the track, FedWeb 2013. The focus was on basic challenges in federated search: (1) resource selection, and (2) results merging. After an overview of the provided data collection and the relevance judgments for the test topics, the participants' individual approaches and results on both tasks are discussed. Promising research directions and an outlook on the 2014 edition of the track are provided as well.

	We describe the participation of the Lowlands at the Web Track and the FedWeb track of TREC 2013. For the Web Track we used the Mirex Map-Reduce library with out-of-the-box approaches and for the FedWeb Track we adapted our shard selection method Taily for resource selection. Here, our results were above median and close to the maximum performance achieved.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes our participation in the resource selection task of the Federated Web Search track at TREC 2013. We employ two general strategies, collection-centric and document-centric, formulated in a language modeling framework. Results show that the document-centric approach delivers solid performance.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper reports on the participation of the University of Padua to the TREC 2013 Federated Web Search track. The objective was the experimental investigation in Federated Web Search setting of TWF·IRF, which is a recursive weighting scheme for resource selection. The experimental results show that the TWF component, that is peculiar of this scheme, is sufficient to obtain an effective search engine ranking in terms of NDCG@20 when compared with the baseline and the runs of other track participants.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper is about work done for result merging task of TREC 2013 Federated Web Track. We introduce three methods for calculating score of documents. These methods are based on linear combination with scores of document fields. The distinction is different weight factors. Score of base line method is the combination with score of basic html fields. Page rank score is added in second method. Documents with lower score are filtered during the third method.

#### NovaSearch at TREC 2013 Federated Web Search Track: Experiments  with rank fusion

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We propose an unsupervised late-fusion approach for the results merging task, based on combining the ranks from all the search engines. Our idea is based on the known pressure for Web search engines to put the most relevant documents at the very top of their ranks and the intuition that relevance of a document should increase as it appears on more search engines [9]. We performed experiments with state-of-the-art rank fusion algorithms: RRF and Condorcet Fuse and our proposed method: Inverse Square Rank (ISR) fusion algorithm. Rank fusion algorithms have low computational complexity and do not need engines to return document scores nor training data. Inverse Square Rank is a novel fully unsupervised rank fusion algorithm based on quadratic decay and on logarithmic document frequency normalization. The results achieved in the competition were very positive and we were able to improve them further post-TREC.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The resource selection task contains a variety of Search Engines (SEs). There exists many domain specific SEs. These SEs can retrieve domain related query results more efficiently, whereas, they are not good at retrieving out-of-domain query results. Thus, it is difficult to predict the performance of a SE in a given query using the results of other queries. In our approach, each query has been searched in the web by all the SEs ( using Google search API's search site option ). We try to predict the performance of each SE with only top 8 retrieved results. Based on the term frequency of each query term in the retrieved results, our method ranks those SEs for that query. At the time of run submission, we missed a few queries. After that, we rank SEs for all queries using the same method. We observed that the result is better in nDCG@20 than the 'median' result. Also, when measured in ERR@20, the result is better in more queries. Median ERR@20, is substantially higher than our result for one query, this affects the average. In the results merging task, the same concept has been applied. Here also, we did not use the actual retrieved results, as it will take time after retrieval. The score of a SE found in the resource selection task, is used here. The documents retrieved by a SE are assigned a score that is a combination of its rank and the SE's score. This can be computed without retrieving actual results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper provides an overview of the work done at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) and Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) for different tracks of TREC 2013. We participated in the Contextual Suggestion Track, the Federated Web Search Track, the Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA) Track, and the Web Ad-hoc Track. In the Contextual Suggestion track, we focused on filtering the entire ClueWeb12 collection to generate recommendations according to the provided user profiles and contexts. For the Federated Web Search track, we exploited both categories from ODP and document relevance to merge result lists. In the KBA track, we focused on the Cumulative Citation Recommendation task where we exploited different features to two classification algorithms. For the Web track, we extended an ad-hoc baseline with a proximity model that promotes documents in which the query terms are positioned closer together.
