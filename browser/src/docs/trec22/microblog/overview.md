This year represents the third iteration of the TREC Microblog track, which began in 2011. There was no substantive change in the task definition, which remains nominally real-time search, best summarized as “At time T, give me the most relevant tweets about topic X.” However, we introduced a radically different evaluation methodology, dubbed “evaluation as a service”, which attempted to address deficiencies in how the document collection was distributed in previous years. This is the first time such an approach has been deployed at TREC. Overall, we believe that the evaluation methodology was successful, drawing participation from twenty groups around the world.
