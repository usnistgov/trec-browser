To make biomedical information more accessible and to meet the requirements for the meaningful use of electronic health records, a goal of modern clinical decision support systems is to anticipate the needs of physicians by linking electronic health records with information relevant for patient care. The Clinical Decision Support Track aims to simulate the requirements of such systems and to encourage the creation of tools and resources necessary for their implementation. The focus of the 2014 track was the retrieval of biomedical articles relevant for answering generic clinical questions about medical records. In the absence of a reusable, de-identified collection of medical records, we used short case reports, such as those published in biomedical articles, as idealized representations of actual medical records. A case report typically describes a challenging medical case, and it is often organized as a well-formed narrative summarizing the portions of a patientâ€™s medical record that are pertinent to the case.
