The TREC Federated Web Search track facilitates research on federated web search, by providing a large realistic data collection sampled from a multitude of online search engines. The FedWeb 2013 Resource Selection and Results Merging tasks are again included in FedWeb 2014, and we additionally introduced the task of vertical selection. Other new aspects are the required link between the Resource Selection and Results Merging tasks, and the importance of diversity in the merged results. After an overview of the new data collection and relevance judgments, the individual participantsâ€™ results for the tasks are introduced, analyzed, and compared.
