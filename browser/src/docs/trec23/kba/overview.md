The Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA) track ran in TREC 2012, 2013, and 2014 as an entitycentric filtering evaluation. This track evaluates systems that filter a time-ordered corpus for documents and slot fills that would change an entity profile in a predefined list of entities. Compared with the 2012 and 2013 evaluations, the 2014 evaluation introduced several refinements, including high-quality community metadata from running Raytheon/BBNâ€™s Serif named entity recognizer, sentence parser, and relation extractor on 579,838,246 English documents in the corpus.
