This year represents the fourth iteration of the TREC Microblog track, which has been running since 2011. The track continued using the “evaluation as a service” model, in which participants had access to the document collection only through an API. In addition to the temporallyanchored ad hoc retrieval task, which has been running since the inception of the track, we introduced a new task called tweet timeline generation (TTG), where the goal is to produce concise “summaries” about a particular topic for human consumption.
