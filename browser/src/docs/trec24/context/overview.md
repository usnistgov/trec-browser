The TREC Contextual Suggestion Track evaluates pointof-interest (POI) recommendation systems, with the goal of creating open and reusable test collections for this purpose. The track imagines a traveler in a unknown city seeking sites to see and things to do that reflect his or her own personal interests, as inferred from their interests in their home city. Given a user's profile, consisting of a POI list and rating from a home city, participants make recommendations for attractions in a target city (i.e., a new context).
