??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The TREC Contextual Suggestion Track evaluates point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems, with the goal of creating open and reusable test collections for this purpose. The track imagines a traveler in a unknown city seeking sites to see and things to do that reflect his or her own personal interests, as inferred from their interests in their home city. Given a user's profile, consisting of a POI list and rating from a home city, participants make recommendations for attractions in a target city (i.e., a new context). For example, imagine a group of information retrieval researchers with a November evening to spend in beautiful Gaithersburg, Maryland. A contextual suggestion system might recommend a beer at the Dogfish Head Alehouse, dinner at the Flaming Pit, or even a trip into Washington on the metro to see the National Mall. This is the fourth year that the track has operated (since TREC 2012). If you are familiar with the track from previous years, here are the big changes this year: The track moved from the open web to a fixed set of documents. The track was split into two tasks: 1. A live task, in which participants set up a server and were sent requests over a period of about three weeks. 2. A batch task, which was similar to the task run in previous years. The live task reflects the track's long term goal of creating a “living lab” service for POI recommendation.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper presents the University of Amsterdam's participation in the TREC 2015 Contextual Suggestion Track. Creating e↵ective profiles for both users and contexts is the main key to build an e↵ective contextual suggestion system. To address these issues, we investigate building users' and groups' profiles for e↵ective contextual personalization and customization. Our main aim is to answer the questions: How to build a user-specific profile that penalizes terms having high probability in negative language models? Can parsimonious language models improve user and context profile's e↵ectiveness? How to combine both models and benefit from both a contextual customization using contextual group profiles and a contextual personalization using users profiles? Our main findings are the following: First, although using parsimonious language model leads to a more compact language model as users' profiles, the personalization performance is as good as using standard language models for building users' profiles. Second, we extensively analyze e↵ectiveness of three di↵erent approaches in taking the negative profiles into account, which improves performance of contextual suggestion models that just uses positive profiles. Third, we learn an e↵ective model for contextual customization and analyze the importance of different contexts in contextual suggestion task. Finally, we propose a linear combination of contextual customization and personalization, which improves the performance of contextual suggestion using either contextual customization or personalization based on all the common used IR metrics.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this work we present a first attempt at developing a live system to solve the problem presented in the TREC 2015 contextual suggestion task1. The goal of this task is to tailor point-of-interest suggestions to users according to their preferences [3]. We present how we gathered data for the candidate points-of-interest, filtered some of the candidates and built a live system to return suggestions that would most likely interest the specific user. As part of TREC 2015, the contextual suggestion track is running for the fourth time [3, 4, 2] and this is the first time that the participants were required to build a live suggestion system. The general idea is to be able to make real-time suggestions for a particular person (based upon their profile) with a particular context. Unlike the previous years where the participants were asked to build their own candidate list of suggestions, this year the organizers themselves released a fixed set of candidate suggestions for 272 contexts, each context representing a city in the United States. Participants were required to set up a server that could listen to requests from users and respond with relevant suggestions. For each request, which is a profile-context pairing, a ranked list of up to 50 ranked suggestions was to be returned. [...]

	In this paper we describe our effort on TREC Contextual Suggestion Track. We present a recommendation system that built upon ElasticSearch along with a machine learning re-ranking model. We utilize real world users' opinion as well as other information to build user profiles. With profile information, we then construct customized ElasticSearch queries to search on various fields. After that, a learning to rank regressor is implemented to give better ranking results. Track results of our submitted runs show the effectiveness of the system.

	An overview of Siena College's participation in the Contextual Suggestion track of the Twenty-Fourth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) is provided in this report. Our goal was to first design a search technique for complex information on specified POI's (points of interest) from a collection set given by TREC. The second part of our task was to return a list of ranked suggestions dependent on a given context and a user's interests. Multiple API's were utilized for information retrieval on each particular POI including Google Places, Foursquare, and Yellow Pages. This process was repeated for not only the POI's being suggested to the user, but for the POI's rated by each user as well. From this information, profile preferences were created for individual users by examining the categories of the POI's that they had rated. To build these preferences, we designed a scoring algorithm to associate a value with each individual category returned by the API's. We finally created a ranking system that includes a unique penalty function to sort our suggestions of attractions specific to each of the users' interests.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes our group's first attempt on the Contextual Suggestion Track of the Twenty-fourth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC 2015). The task aims to provide recommendations on attractions for various kinds of users under different and complex contexts. TREC provides two ways to participate in the track: one is to create a web server that can respond to contextual related queries called “Live Experiment”, the other is to submit run files that have all the responses to the released requests called “Batch Experiment”. For Live Experiment, due to lack of training data, our approach sticks closely to the defined relevance judgement criteria and context knowledge. We take linear interpolation to combine a variety of factors and contextual related knowledge. For Batch Experiment, we further consider domain preference under user attributes, and take existing Machine Learning based methods in principle. We show that feature engineering is a vital part for attraction suggestions. We find that the performance of suggestions to the provided user profiles and contexts has been improved using domain preference analysis.

	In this paper we describe our effort on TREC 2015 Contextual Suggestion Track. Using opinions from online resources to model both user profile and candidate profile has been proven to be effective on previous TREC. This year we also leverage the power of building profile based on opinions. Opinions from well known commercial online resources are collected in order to build the profiles. Two kinds of opinion representations are used for the two submitted runs. Linear interpolation is leveraged to rank the candidate suggestions. Additionally, an advanced context filter which considers all possible factors such as trip type and trip duration is applied to the ranking results so that unwanted venues are removed from the final ranking list. Official results of our submitted runs show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

	This technical report presents the work of the University of Lugano at TREC 2015 Contextual Suggestion and Temporal Summarization tracks. The first track that we report on, is the Contextual Suggestion. The goal of the Contextual Suggestion track is to develop systems that could generate user-specific suggestions that a user might potentially like. Our proposed method attempts to model the users' behavior and interest using a classifier, and enrich the basic model using additional data sources. Our results illustrate that our proposed method performed very well in terms of all used evaluation metrics. The second track that we report on, is the Temporal Summarization that aims to develop systems that can detect useful, new, and timely updates about a certain event. Our proposed method selects sentences that are relevant and novel to a specific event with the aim to create a summary for this event. The results showed that the proposed method is very e↵ective in terms of Latency Comprehensiveness (LC). However, the approach did not manage to obtain a good performance in terms of Expected Latency Gain (ELG).

	n TREC 2015, we focus on tackling the challenges posed by the Contextual Suggestion, Temporal Summarisation and Dynamic Domain tracks. For Contextual Suggestion, we investigate the use of user-generated data in location-based social networks (LBSN) to suggest venues. For Temporal Summarisation, we examine features for event summarisation that explicitly model the entities involved in the events. Meanwhile, for the Dynamic Domain track, we explore resource selection techniques for identifying the domain of interest and diversifying sub-topic intents.
