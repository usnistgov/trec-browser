The TREC 2015 Microblog track introduced a single realtime filtering task broken down into two scenarios. Our goal is to explore techniques for monitoring streams of social media posts with respect to users’ interest profiles. An interest profile describes a topic about which the user wishes to receive information updates in real time, and is different from a typical ad hoc topic in that the profile represents a prospective (as opposed to a retrospective) information need. Thus, the nature of the desired information is qualitatively different. In real-time filtering, the goal is for a system to “push” (i.e., recommend, suggest) interesting and novel content to users in a timely fashion.
