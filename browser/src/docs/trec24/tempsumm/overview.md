There are many summarization scenarios that require updates to be issued to users over time. For example, during unexpected news events such as natural disasters or mass protests new information rapidly emerges. The TREC Temporal Summarization track aims to investigate how to effectively summarize these types of event in real-time. In particular, the goal is to develop systems which can detect useful, new, and timely sentence-length updates about a developing event to return to the user. In contrast to classical summarization challenges (such as DUC or TAC), the summaries produced by the participant systems are evaluated against a ground truth list of information nuggets representing the space of information that a user might want to know about each event. An optimal summary will cover all of the information nuggets in the minimum number of sentences. Also in contrast to classic summarization and newer timeline generation tasks, the Temporal Summarization track focuses on performing this analysis online as documents are indexed.
