The SWIRL 2012 workshop on frontiers, challenges, and opportunities for information retrieval report [1] noted many important challenges. Among them, challenges such as conversational answer retrieval, subdocument retrieval, and answer aggregation share commonalities: We desire answers to complex needs, and wish to find them in a single and well-presented source. Advancing the state of the art in this area is the goal of this TREC track. Consider a user investigating a new and unfamiliar topic. This user would often be best served with a single summary, rather than being required to synthesize his or her own summary from multiple sources. This is especially the case in mobile environments with restricted interaction capabilities. While these have led to extensive work on finding the best short answer, the target in this track is the retrieval of comprehensive answers that are composed of multiple text fragments from multiple sources. Retrieving high-quality longer answers is challenging as it is not sufficient to choose a lower rank-cutoff with the same techniques as for short answers. Instead, we need new approaches for finding relevant information in a complex answer space. Many examples of manually created complex answers exist on the Web. Famous examples are articles from how-stuff-works.com, travel guides, or fanzines. These are collections of articles, that each constitutes a long answer to an information need represented by the title of the article. The fundamental task of collecting references, facts, and opinions into a single coherent summary has traditionally been a manual process. We envision that automated information retrieval systems can relieve users from a large amount of manual work through sub-document retrieval, consolidation and organization. Ultimately, the goal is to retrieve synthesized information rather than documents.
