The primary goal of the TREC Common Core track is three-fold: (a) bring the information retrieval community back into a traditional ad-hoc search task; (b) attract a diverse set of participating runs and build a new test collections using more recently created documents; (c) establish a (new) test collection construction methodology that avoids the pitfalls of depth-k pooling. A number of side-goals are also set, including studying the shortcomings of test collections constructed in the past; experimenting with new ideas for constructing test collections; expand test collections by new participant tasks (ad-hoc/interactive), new relevance judgments (binary/multilevel), new pooling methods, new assessment resources (NIST / crowd-sourcing) and new retrieval systems contributing documents (manual/neural/strong baselines).
