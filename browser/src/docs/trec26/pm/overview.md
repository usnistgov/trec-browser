For many complex diseases, there is no “one size fits all” solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is the hallmark of the emerging “precision medicine” paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely felt than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient’s tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes a Precision Medicine Initiative (Collins and Varmus, 2015) launched by former President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program. A fundamental difficulty with putting the findings of precision medicine into practice is that–by its very nature–precision medicine creates a huge space of treatment options (Frey et al., 2016). These can easily overwhelm clinicians attempting to stay up-to-date with the latest findings, and can easily inhibit a clinician’s attempts to determine the best possible treatment for a particular patient. However, the ability to quickly locate relevant evidence is the hallmark of information retrieval (IR). Further, for three consecutive years the TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track has sought to evaluate IR systems that provide medical evidence to the point-of-care. It was natural, then, to specialize the CDS track to the needs of precision medicine so IR systems can focus on this important issue. The 2017 Precision Medicine track focused on a single field, oncology, for a specific use case, genetic mutations of cancer. As described above, main idea behind precision medicine is to use detailed patient information (largely genetic information in most current research) to identify the most effective treatments. Improving patient care in precision oncology then requires both (a) a mechanism to locate the latest research relevant to a patient, and (b) a fallback mechanism to locate the most relevant clinical trials when the latest techniques prove ineffective for a patient. In the first part, the track continues the previous Clinical Decision Support track (with a more focused use case), while in the second part expands the task to cover a new type of data (clinical trial descriptions).
