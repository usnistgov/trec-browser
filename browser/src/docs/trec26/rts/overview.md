The TREC 2017 Real-Time Summarization (RTS) Track is the second iteration of a community effort to explore techniques, algorithms, and systems that automatically monitor streams of social media posts such as tweets on Twier to address users’ prospective information needs. These needs are articulated as “interest profiles”, akin to topics in ad hoc retrieval. In real-time summarization, the goal is for a system to deliver interesting and novel content to users in a timely fashion. We refer to these messages generically as “updates”.
