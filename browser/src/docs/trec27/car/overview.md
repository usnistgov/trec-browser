Current retrieval systems provide good solutions towards phrase-level retrieval for simple fact and entity-centric needs. This track encourages research for answering more complex information needs with longer answers. Much like Wikipedia pages synthesize knowledge that is globally distributed, we envision systems that collect relevant information from an entire corpus, creating synthetically structured documents by collating retrieved results.
