??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This notebook gives an overview of activities, datasets, and results of the second year of TREC Complex Answer Retrieval. We lay out the tasks offered and how provided datasets are automatically derived from Wikipedia and TQA. Manual relevance assessments are created by NIST. We describe the details of the assessment procedures, inter-annotator agreement, and statistics. Nine teams submitted runs exploring interactions of entities and passages, neural as well as traditional retrieval methods. We see that combining traditional methods with learning-to-rank can outperform neural methods, even when many training queries are available.

	We participated in the Complex Answer Retrieval(CAR) Track at TREC 2018. We propose a Markov random field based framework concerning unigrams, bigrams and concepts from differnt query sections. Besides, we employ a language modelling framework facilitating the Wikipedia article information and query entity mentions. Our best passage run achieves NDCG@5 of 0.3503 and MAP of 0.1715.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this summary we present a simple and unsupervised Semantic Query Expansion model (SemQueryExp) for Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR). TREC CAR is a large-scale information retrieval shared evaluation task based on Wikipedia content. We have participated in the Passage Ranking Task of TREC CAR. Queries are provided as hierarchical section outlines and the goal is to retrieve the relevant paragraph, i.e., the original Wikipedia paragraphs of the respective section. The queries consist of the page title in which the section appears, the name of the main section and one or more sub-level sections (e.g., Thompson Capper // Early career // South African service). A section in turn contains a number of terms that we want to use in order to expand the query with semantically related terms. Here we rely on 300-dimensional GloVe [1] word embeddings, pre-trained on Wikipedia. For each word in the query we lookup its embedding, search for the k-nearest-neighbors and add the corresponding words to the query. Distances between word embeddings are measured with the cosine similarity. The final query consists now of its original query terms as well as the words added during query expansion. We assume that words appearing in lower sub-section levels, i.e. more specific sections, capture more relevance for the query than words appearing on higher levels such as the page title, which only describe the surrounding theme. This is encoded by assigning each query term a weight according to it's level in the hierarchical outline. If a word is in the title it receives a weight of 1, if it is in the main section it receives a weight of 2, etc. Expanded query terms are assumed to be noisy and scored with a value ranging between 0 and 1, depending on their cosine similarity. The final query consists of the union of all terms appearing in the outline and the expanded query terms, coupled with respective weights. All data is normalized by removing stop words and applying lemmatization. We execute the query on a Lucene index as a BoostedQuery using the BM25 retrieval model. We used no external data and we tuned the value of the parameter k on the benchmarkY1-train portion of the TREC CAR dataset.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this work, we present our approach to the 2018 TREC Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) task. We submitted two passage retrieval runs. The first uses the state-of-the-art technique from TREC CAR 2017: a modified neural ranker modified to incorporate query heading frequency information while performing term matching on each heading independently. The second run incorporates a novel gated technique for incorporating query expansion terms in a neural ranker. Our TREC runs indicate significant performance improvements can be achieved when using the expansion approach.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Finding answers to complex questions within a corpus of Wikipedia paragraphs needs to account for (a) the similarity between questions and paragraphs as well as (b) their shared semantics. In our participation in the 2018 TREC CAR track, we focused on developing a novel neural paragraph ranking model in our existing CAPAR system, developed for the 2017 TREC CAR track. The new system TRANS-CAPAR, takes advantage of the recently introduced Transformer architecture to encode information from the question and to semantically decode it in each paragraph. The results obtained during the official evaluations indicate that TRANSCAPAR makes good use of both discourse context and similarity when ranking paragraphs.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we describe our submission to the TREC-CAR 2018. We use a method introduced by Nogueira et al. (2018) to efficiently learn diverse strategies in reinforcement learning for query reformulation and focus minimally on the ranking function. In this framework, an agent consists of multiple specialized sub-agents and a meta-agent that learns to aggregate the answers from sub-agents to produce a final answer. Sub-agents are trained on disjoint partitions of the training data, while the meta-agent is trained on the full training set. Our method makes learning faster, because it is highly parallelizable, and has better generalization performance than strong baselines, such as an ensemble of agents trained on the full data.
