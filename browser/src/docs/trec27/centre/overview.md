{==

The CLEF-NTCIR-TREC Reproducibility track (CENTRE) is a research replication and reproduction effort spanning three major information retrieval evaluation venues. In the TREC edition, CENTRE participants were asked to reproduce runs from either the TREC 2016 clinical decision support track, the 2013 web track, or the 2014 web track. Only one group participated in the track, and unfortunately the track will not continue in 2019.
