{==

The primary goals of the proposed core track are three-fold: (a) to bring together the community in a common track that could lead to a diverse set of participating runs, (b) to build one or more new test collections using more recently created documents, and (c) to establish a (new) test collection construction methodology that avoids the pitfalls of depth-k pooling.
