??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The News track is a new track for TREC 2019, focused on information retrieval in the service of helping people read the news. In cooperation with the Washington Post1, we released a new collection of 600,000 news articles, and crafted two tasks related to how news is presented on the web.

	This paper describes our participation in the background linking task of the TREC 2018 News Track. We explored four different methods to address the task. All of our methods largely rely on off-the-shelf open-source components (e.g., Apache Lucene for indexing the documents). The methods differ in how they analyze the given input document to obtain a query (e.g., by keyword extraction or named entity recognition) and to what extent the returned results are re-ranked taking meta data of the documents (e.g., publication dates) into account.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper we present our participation as SINAI research group from the Universidad de Ja´en at Text REtrieval Conceference (TREC) in the News task. Specifically we have participated in sub-task 1 called Background Linking. In this task we try to apply K-means clustering algorithms to obtain related news from different domains and topics. We also use document reordering techniques to obtain a new ordered list of relevant articles. For text processing we use the popular TF-IDF technique. The results obtained have not overcome the proposed baseline, although we are usually above average, improving in some cases 78% the average

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	When reading a news article, it is very useful that articles about the background of various aspects of the story are provided so that the readers can better understand the story. In this year's News Track, we tried to use paragraphs as leads to find background articles since they tend to cover different aspects of the main story [3]. More specifically, the keywords in the paragraphs were extracted and used as queries to find background articles. Entities were also leveraged to improve the retrieval performances of the keyword queries.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper provides an overview of the experiments we carried out for the entity ranking task at the TREC 2018 News Track. In particular, we experimented with adapting the supervised salience component of Salient Entity Linking (SEL), a state-of-the-art unified framework for entity linking and salience ranking. In our adaptation, we assume perfect entity linking performance and rank the entities using the salience components of SEL. Furthermore, in this adaptation, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the supervised salience ranking, and also to introduce sentiment-based features for entity salience.

#### Anserini at trec 2018: Centre, Common Core, and News Tracks

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Anserini is an open-source information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene [3, 4]. The goal of our effort is to support information retrieval research using the popular open-source Lucene search library by allowing researchers to easily replicate results with modern ranking models on diverse test collections. Although there are many open-source search engines developed and maintained by academic research groups, most of them are designed primarily to facilitate the publication of research papers, and as such, they often suffer from poor usability, incomplete documentation, and a host of other issues. The growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the diverse capabilities that are required to build useful end-to-end search applications places academic research groups at a huge disadvantage relative to Lucene. Except for a handful of commercial web search engines that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building production search applications—used by organizations as diverse as Twitter, Reddit, Bloomberg, and Target. It has an active developer base, diverse features and capabilities, and lies at the center of a vibrant ecosystem. However, Lucene lacks systematic support for information retrieval research—in particular, ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. This is where Anserini comes in: we enable cutting-edge information retrieval research using Lucene. At TREC 2018, we participated in the CENTRE, Common Core, and News Tracks. Each is described in its own section below. Our development efforts centered around the v0.1.0 release of Anserini, which is based on Lucene 6.3.0 (not the latest release).
