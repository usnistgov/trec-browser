The fundamental philosophy behind precision medicine is that for many complex diseases, there is no “one size fits all” solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is thus the hallmark of the emerging precision medicine paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely focused at the moment than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient’s tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative (Collins and Varmus, 2015) launched by former President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program. A fundamental difficulty with putting the findings of precision medicine into practice is that–by its very nature–precision medicine creates a huge space of treatment options (Frey et al., 2016). These can easily overwhelm clinicians attempting to stay up-to-date with the latest findings, and can easily inhibit a clinician’s attempts to determine the best possible treatment for a particular patient. However, the ability to quickly locate relevant evidence is the hallmark of information retrieval (IR). For three consecutive years the TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track sought to evaluate IR systems that provide medical evidence at the point-of-care. The TREC Precision Medicine track, then, was launched to specialize the CDS track to the needs of precision medicine so IR systems can focus on this important issue. The Precision Medicine track has focused on a single field, oncology, for a specific use case, genetic mutations of cancer. This started with the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track and continued with the 2018 track described here. As described above, the main idea behind precision medicine is to use detailed patient information (largely genomic information in most current research) to identify the most effective treatments. Improving patient care in precision oncology then requires both (a) a mechanism to locate the latest research relevant to a patient, and (b) a fallback mechanism to locate the most relevant clinical trials when the latest techniques prove ineffective for a patient. In the first part, the track continues the previous Clinical Decision Support track (with a more focused use case), while in the second part expands the task to cover a new type of data (clinical trial descriptions). No substantial changes to the 2017 track were made for 2018 (with the exception of new, and an increased number of, topics). Since 2017 was the first year of the track, keeping minimal changes was an intentional choice to allow participants to develop new methods using the results of the prior year as a guide (2017 participants had no gold standard to utilize for system development).

## Common Core

[`Overview`](./core/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./core/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./core/data.md), [`Results`](./core/results.md), [`Runs`](./core/runs.md), [`Participants`](./core/participants.md)

{==

The primary goals of the proposed core track are three-fold: (a) to bring together the community in a common track that could lead to a diverse set of participating runs, (b) to build one or more new test collections using more recently created documents, and (c) to establish a (new) test collection construction methodology that avoids the pitfalls of depth-k pooling.

## Real-time Summarization

[`Overview`](./rts/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./rts/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./rts/data.md), [`Runs`](./rts/runs.md), [`Participants`](./rts/participants.md)

{==

The TREC 2018 Real-Time Summarization (RTS) Track is the third iteration of a community eort to explore techniques, algorithms, and systems that automatically monitor streams of social media posts such as tweets on Twier to address users’ prospective information needs. ese needs are articulated as “interest proles”, akin to topics in ad hoc retrieval. In our formulation of real-time summarization, the goal is for a system to deliver relevant and novel content to users in a timely fashion. We refer to these messages generically as “updates”.

## Complex Answer Retrieval

[`Overview`](./car/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./car/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./car/data.md), [`Runs`](./car/runs.md), [`Participants`](./car/participants.md)

{==

Current retrieval systems provide good solutions towards phrase-level retrieval for simple fact and entity-centric needs. This track encourages research for answering more complex information needs with longer answers. Much like Wikipedia pages synthesize knowledge that is globally distributed, we envision systems that collect relevant information from an entire corpus, creating synthetically structured documents by collating retrieved results.

## News

[`Overview`](./news/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./news/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./news/data.md), [`Results`](./news/results.md), [`Runs`](./news/runs.md), [`Participants`](./news/participants.md)

{==

The News track is a new track for TREC 2019, focused on information retrieval in the service of helping people read the news. In cooperation with the Washington Post, we released a new collection of 600,000 news articles, and crafted two tasks related to how news is presented on the web.

## Incident Streams

{==

The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Incident Streams track is a new initiative that aims to mature social media-based emergency response technology. This initiative advances the state of the art in this area through an evaluation challenge, which attracts researchers and developers from across the globe. The 2018 edition of the track provides a standardized evaluation methodology, an ontology of emergency-relevant social media information types, proposes a scale for information criticality, and releases a dataset containing fifteen test events and approximately 20,000 labeled tweets. Analysis of this dataset reveals a significant amount of actionable information on social media during emergencies (> 10%). While this data is valuable for emergency response efforts, analysis of the 39 state-of-the-art systems demonstrate a performance gap in identifying this data. We therefore find the current state-of-the-art is insufficient for emergency responders’ requirements, particularly for rare actionable information for which there is little prior training data available.

## CENTRE

[`Overview`](./centre/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./centre/proceedings.md), [`Runs`](./centre/runs.md), [`Participants`](./centre/participants.md)

{==

The CLEF-NTCIR-TREC Reproducibility track (CENTRE) is a research replication and reproduction effort spanning three major information retrieval evaluation venues. In the TREC edition, CENTRE participants were asked to reproduce runs from either the TREC 2016 clinical decision support track, the 2013 web track, or the 2014 web track. Only one group participated in the track, and unfortunately the track will not continue in 2019.
