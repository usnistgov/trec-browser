The fundamental philosophy behind precision medicine is that for many complex diseases, there is no “one size fits all” solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is thus the hallmark of the emerging precision medicine paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely focused at the moment than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient’s tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative (Collins and Varmus, 2015) launched by former President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program. A fundamental difficulty with putting the findings of precision medicine into practice is that–by its very nature–precision medicine creates a huge space of treatment options (Frey et al., 2016). These can easily overwhelm clinicians attempting to stay up-to-date with the latest findings, and can easily inhibit a clinician’s attempts to determine the best possible treatment for a particular patient. However, the ability to quickly locate relevant evidence is the hallmark of information retrieval (IR). For three consecutive years the TREC Clinical Decision Support (CDS) track sought to evaluate IR systems that provide medical evidence at the point-of-care. The TREC Precision Medicine track, then, was launched to specialize the CDS track to the needs of precision medicine so IR systems can focus on this important issue. The Precision Medicine track has focused on a single field, oncology, for a specific use case, genetic mutations of cancer. This started with the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track and continued with the 2018 track described here. As described above, the main idea behind precision medicine is to use detailed patient information (largely genomic information in most current research) to identify the most effective treatments. Improving patient care in precision oncology then requires both (a) a mechanism to locate the latest research relevant to a patient, and (b) a fallback mechanism to locate the most relevant clinical trials when the latest techniques prove ineffective for a patient. In the first part, the track continues the previous Clinical Decision Support track (with a more focused use case), while in the second part expands the task to cover a new type of data (clinical trial descriptions). No substantial changes to the 2017 track were made for 2018 (with the exception of new, and an increased number of, topics). Since 2017 was the first year of the track, keeping minimal changes was an intentional choice to allow participants to develop new methods using the results of the prior year as a guide (2017 participants had no gold standard to utilize for system development).
