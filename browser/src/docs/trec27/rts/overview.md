The TREC 2018 Real-Time Summarization (RTS) Track is the third iteration of a community eort to explore techniques, algorithms, and systems that automatically monitor streams of social media posts such as tweets on Twier to address users’ prospective information needs. ese needs are articulated as “interest proles”, akin to topics in ad hoc retrieval. In our formulation of real-time summarization, the goal is for a system to deliver relevant and novel content to users in a timely fashion. We refer to these messages generically as “updates”.
