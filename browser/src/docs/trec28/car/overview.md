{==

The vision of TREC Complex Answer Retrieval is to create complex long-form answers in response to a wide-variety information needs. In general, we aspire to create answers that are reminiscent to Wikipedia articles or school text books (e.g. TQA). However, while the vast majority of Wikipedia articles are about people, in TREC CAR we aim at information needs that are off the beaten path, covering topics in popular science, technology, and illnesses.
