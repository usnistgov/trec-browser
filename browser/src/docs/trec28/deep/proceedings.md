??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes the experiment conducted for our participation in the TREC-2019 Deep Learning track [1]. We test the effectiveness of two pre-trained language models, BERT [2] and XLNet [3], for the re-ranking subtask of the document ranking task, with an adoption of the passage-level document ranking approach as proposed in [4]. Our preliminary results indicate that the uses of BERT and XLNet lead to comparable performance.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes our participation in the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track document ranking task. We developed a deep learning based document term weighting approach based on our previous work of DeepCT. It used the contextualized token embeddings generated by BERT to estimate a term's importance in passages, and combines passage term weights into document-level term weights. The weighted document is stored in an ordinary inverted index and searched using a multi-field BM25, which is efficient. We tested two ways of training DeepCT: a query-based method using sparse relevant query-document pairs, and a weakly-supervised method using document title-body pairs.

	This paper details our participation in the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track task including Passage Ranking task. In the Top-1000 Re-ranking subtask of Passage Ranking task, we performed passage ranking based on the technique of Conv-KNRM and BERT. In order to get a better ranking result, we divided the task into two stages. In the first stage we use Conv-KNRM model for initial ranking, then in the second stage we combine the results with a state-of-the-art BERT re-ranker.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The usage of neural network models puts multiple objectives in conflict with each other: Ideally we would like to create a neural model that is effective, efficient, and interpretable at the same time. However, in most instances we have to choose which property is most important to us. We used the opportunity of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning track to evaluate the effectiveness of a balanced neural re-ranking approach. We submitted results of the TK (Transformer-Kernel) model: a neural re-ranking model for ad-hoc search using an efficient contextualization mechanism. TK employs a very small number of lightweight Transformer layers to contextualize query and document word embeddings. To score individual term interactions, we use a document-length enhanced kernel-pooling, which enables users to gain insight into the model. Our best result for the passage ranking task is: 0.420 MAP, 0.671 nDCG, 0.598 P@10 (TUW19-p3 full). Our best result for the document ranking task is: 0.271 MAP, 0.465 nDCG, 0.730 P@10 (TUW19-d3 re-ranking).

	The deep learning track consists of two tasks: passage ranking and document ranking. The former focuses on long text retrieval, while the latter focuses on short text retrieval. Both tasks use a large human-labeled set, which is from the MS-MARCO dataset. For different emphases of the two tasks, we adopt two different BERT-based retrieval models. In Section 2 and 3, we will introduce our methods in details. In Section 4 and 5, we will discuss the experiments setting and results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The TREC 2019 Deep Learning task aims at studying information retrieval in a large training data regime. It includes two tasks: the document ranking task (1) and the passage ranking task (2). Both of these tasks had a full ranking (a) and reranking (b) subtasks. The SIB Text Mining group participated at the full document ranking subtask (1a). In order to retrieve pertinent documents in the 3.2 million documents corpus, our strategy was two-fold. At first, we used a BM25 model to retrieve a subset of documents relevant to a query. We also tried to improve recall by using query expansion. The second step consisted in reranking the retrieved subset using an original model, so-called query2doc. This model, which has been designed to predict if a query-document pair was a good candidate to be ranked in position #1, was trained using the training dataset provided for the task. Our baseline, which is basically a BM25 ranking performed the best and achieve a MAP of 0.2892. Results of the query2doc run clearly indicates that the query2doc model could not learn any meaningful relationship. More precisely, to explain such a failure, we hypothesize that using documents returned by our baseline model as negative items confused our model. As future steps, it will be interesting to take into account features such as the document's BM25 score as well as the number of times a document's URL is mentioned in the corpus and use them along with learning to rank algorithms.

	This report discusses three submissions based on the Duet architecture to the Deep Learning track at TREC 2019. For the document retrieval task, we adapt the Duet model to ingest a “multiple field” view of documents—we refer to the new architecture as Duet with Multiple Fields (DuetMF). A second submission combines the DuetMF model with other neural and traditional relevance estimators in a learning-to-rank framework and achieves improved performance over the DuetMF baseline. For the passage retrieval task, we submit a single run based on an ensemble of eight Duet models.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC 2019, we focus on combining deep learning methods with traditional information retrieval methods, by using deep learning scores as an extra feature in the re-ranking process. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques based on the state-of-the-art BERT contextual language models, as well as tak- ing into account alternative query reformulations in the re-ranking process. We submitted three official runs to the document ranking task: uogTrDNN6LM, uogTrDSS6pLM, and uogTrDSSQE5LM, where all three runs deploy a deep learning method and the LambdaMART learning-to-rank method. Our results show that uogTrDNN6LM is competitive, performing above the TREC median in terms of MAP and NDCG, yet a simple untrained DFR query expansion run was more effective.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes our participation in the passage and document ranking tasks of TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track. We propose a two-stage cascade ranking pipeline by taking the advantages of sequence-to-sequence generation and pre-trained language modeling. Firstly, we use a simple and effective index-based method to retrieve a collection of candidate passages. To overcome the vocabulary mismatch problem, we propose a query generation method for document expansion based on the pointer-generator model, where each passage is expanded with a set of generated queries for higher recall in the retrieval of candidate passages. Then we pre-train a BERT language model with a new sentence prediction objective, and adopt a pointwise ranking strategy for re-ranking the remained candidate passages. Our cascade ranking method achieves the best results among all participants on both the passage ranking and document ranking tasks, according to the official evaluation metric NDCG@10.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes Brown University's submission to the TREC 2019 Deep Learning track. We followed a 2-phase method for producing a ranking of passages for a given input query: In the the first phase, the user's query is expanded by appending 3 queries generated by a transformer model which was trained to rephrase an input query into semantically similar queries. The expanded query can exhibit greater similarity in surface form and vocabulary overlap with the passages of interest and can therefore serve as enriched input to any downstream information retrieval method. In the second phase, we use a BERT-based model pre-trained for language modeling but fine-tuned for query - document relevance prediction to compute relevance scores for a set of 1000 candidate passages per query and subsequently obtain a ranking of passages by sorting them based on the predicted relevance scores.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This is the first year of TREC for deep learning and there are two tasks which are document ranking and passage ranking. Our task is passage ranking which can be described as given a query q and the 1000 most relevant passages p1, p2, ..., p1000 retrieved by BM25, passage ranking task expects to come up with a successful system to rank the most relevant passage as high as possible. In this work, we build a neural network based IR model for the passage rank- ing tasks. Basically we are trying to combine BERT [2] and highway network [6] to get a good performance on the task. Since BERT is the current SOTA model on several nlp related tasks and highway network [6] is kind of neural network with gate structure, since gate structure has already shown its success on some neural network models like lstm [3] and gru [1] on sequence modeling tasks. So we assume combining multi-head attention based transformer with gate based network structure to improve the model performance can be achieved. Meanwhile we also try different loss functions and different training strategies also with axiomatic thinking [5] approach.
