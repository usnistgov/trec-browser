The ubiquity of mobile internet-enabled devices combined with wide-spread social media use during emergencies is posing new challenges for response personnel. In particular, service operators are now expected to monitor these online channels to extract actionable insights and answer questions from the public. A lack of adequate tools makes this monitoring impractical at the scale of many emergencies. The TREC Incident Streams (TREC-IS) track drives research into solving this technology gap by bringing together academia and industry to develop techniques for extracting actionable insights from social media streams during emergencies. This paper covers the second year of TREC-IS, hosted in 2019 with two editions, 2019-A and 2019-B, contributing 12 new events and approximately 20,000 new tweets across 25 information categories, with 15 research groups participating across the world. This paper provides an overview of these new editions, actionable insights from data labelling, and the automated techniques employed by participant systems that appear most effective.
