The News track focuses on information retrieval in the service of helping people read the news. In 2018, in cooperation with the Washington Post, we released a new collection of nearly 600,000 news articles, and crafted two tasks related to how news is presented on the web: background linking and entity ranking. This second iteration of the track continues these two tasks with minor updates.
