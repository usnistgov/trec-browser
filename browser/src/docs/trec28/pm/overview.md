Precision medicine is a medical paradigm in which treatments are customized entirely to the individual patient. The underlying issue that drives precision medicine is that for many complex diseases, there are no “one size fits all” solutions for patients with a particular diagnosis. The proper treatment for a patient depends upon genetic, environmental, and lifestyle choices. The ability to personalize treatment in a scientifically rigorous manner based on these factors is thus the hallmark of the emerging precision medicine paradigm. Nowhere is the potential impact of precision medicine more closely focused at the moment than in cancer, where lifesaving treatments for particular patients could prove ineffective or even deadly for other patients based entirely upon the particular genetic mutations in the patient’s tumor(s). Significant effort, therefore, has been devoted to deepening the scientific research surrounding precision medicine. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative (Collins and Varmus, 2015) launched by President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program.
