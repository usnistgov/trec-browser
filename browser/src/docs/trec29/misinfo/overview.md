TREC 2020 was the second year for the Health Misinformation track, which was named the Decision Track in 2019. Information retrieval using document collections that contain misinformation are problematic. When a search engine returns documents that contain misinformation, users may have difficulty discerning correct from incorrect information and the incorrect information can lead to incorrect decisions. Decisions regarding health-related topics can be consequential, and as such we want search engines that enable users to make correct decisions. The track is designed to address the problem of health misinformation in three areas: 1) adhoc retrieval, 2) the total recall of misinformation in the collection, and 3) the evaluation of retrieval in the presence of misinformation. The 2020 Health Misinformation track had both a recall task and an adhoc task for participants.
