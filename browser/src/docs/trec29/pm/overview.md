The precision medicine paradigm focuses on identifying treatments that are best suited to an individual patient’s unique attributes. The reasoning behind this paradigm is that diseases do not uniformly manifest in people and thus “one size fits all” treatments are often not appropriate. For many diseases, such as cancer, proper selection of a treatment strategy can drastically improve results compared to the standard, frontline treatment. Generally speaking, the issues that are taken into consideration for precision medicine are the genomic, environmental, and lifestyle contexts of the patient. While precision medicine as a paradigm can be seen to broadly apply to medicine as a whole, the area where it has seen the most attention is cancer. Many cancer treatments may be lifesaving in one patient but deadly in another, primarily based on the genetic mutations of the patient’s tumor. Different treatments for the same type of cancer often target the genetic pathways applicable to the specific tumor’s genes. As a result, there has been a significant amount of effort devoted to identifying these genetic pathways, identifying potential drugs that could target different aspects of these pathways, and assessing the clinical efficacy of these drugs in human studies. This includes the Precision Medicine Initiative (Collins and Varmus, 2015) launched by President Barack Obama in 2015, now known as the All of Us Research Program.
