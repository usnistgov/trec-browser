{==

The precision medicine paradigm focuses on identifying treatments that are best suited to an individual patient’s unique attributes. The reasoning behind this paradigm is that diseases do not uniformly manifest in people and thus “one size fits all” treatments are often not appropriate. For many diseases, such as cancer, proper selection of a treatment strategy can drastically improve results compared to the standard, frontline treatment. Generally speaking, the issues that are taken into consideration for precision medicine are the genomic, environmental, and lifestyle contexts of the patient.
