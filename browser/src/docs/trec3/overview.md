{==

The ad hoc task investigates the performance of systems that search a static set of documents using new topics. This task is similar to how a researcher might use a library â€” the collection is known but the questions likely to be asked are not known.

## Routing

[`Overview`](./routing/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./routing/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./routing/data.md), [`Results`](./routing/results.md), [`Runs`](./routing/runs.md), [`Participants`](./routing/participants.md)

{==

In TREC the routing task is represented by using known topics and known relevant documents for those topics, but new data for testing. The participants are given a set of known (or training) topics, along with a set of documents, including known relevant documents for those topics. The topics consist of natural language text describing a user's information need. The topics are used to create a set of queries (the actual input to the retrieval system) which are then used against the training documents.
