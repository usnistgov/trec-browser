# Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 1994

**Donna Harman, Overview of the Third Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-3):**

The TREC-3 results reflect some of that more complex experimentation. For some groups that meant more extensive experiments based on their basic system techniques. For other groups it involved trying techniques from other groups and exploring more hybrid approaches. Some groups tried approaches that were radically different from their original approaches. As should be expected, those groups new to TREC had the same scaling problems as seen in TREC-1.
