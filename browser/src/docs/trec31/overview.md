# Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) 2022 

## NeuCLIR

[`Overview`](./neuclir/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./neuclir/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./neuclir/data.md), [`Results`](./neuclir/results.md), [`Runs`](./neuclir/runs.md), [`Participants`](./neuclir/participants.md)

{==

Cross-language Information Retrieval (CLIR) has been studied at TREC and subsequent evaluation forums for more than twenty years, but recent advances in the application of deep learning to information retrieval (IR) warrant a new, large-scale effort that will enable exploration of classical and modern IR techniques for this task.

## Health Misinformation

[`Overview`](./misinfo/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./misinfo/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./misinfo/data.md), [`Results`](./misinfo/results.md), [`Runs`](./misinfo/runs.md), [`Participants`](./misinfo/participants.md)

{==

The Health Misinformation track aims to (1) provide a venue for research on retrieval methods that promote better decision making with search engines, and (2) develop new online and offline evaluation methods to predict the decision making quality induced by search results. Consumer health information is used as the domain of interest in the track.

## Deep Learning

[`Overview`](./deep/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./deep/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./deep/data.md), [`Results`](./deep/results.md), [`Runs`](./deep/runs.md), [`Participants`](./deep/participants.md)

{==

The Deep Learning track focuses on IR tasks where a large training set is available, allowing us to compare a variety of retrieval approaches including deep neural networks and strong non-neural approaches, to see what works best in a large-data regime.

## Conversational Assistance

[`Overview`](./cast/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./cast/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./cast/data.md), [`Results`](./cast/results.md), [`Runs`](./cast/runs.md), [`Participants`](./cast/participants.md)

{==

The main aim of Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT) is to advance research on conversational search systems. The goal of the track is to create reusable benchmarks for open-domain information centric conversational dialogues.

## Clinical Trials

[`Overview`](./trials/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./trials/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./trials/data.md), [`Results`](./trials/results.md), [`Runs`](./trials/runs.md), [`Participants`](./trials/participants.md)

{==

The goal of the Clinical Trials track is to focus research on the clinical trials matching problem: given a free text summary of a patient health record, find suitable clinical trials for that patient.

## Fair Ranking

[`Overview`](./fair/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./fair/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./fair/data.md), [`Runs`](./fair/runs.md), [`Participants`](./fair/participants.md)

{==

The Fair Ranking track focuses on building two-sided systems that offer fair exposure to ranked content producers while ensuring high results quality for ranking consumers.

## CrisisFACTs

[`Overview`](./crisis/overview.md), [`Proceedings`](./crisis/proceedings.md), [`Data`](./crisis/data.md), [`Runs`](./crisis/runs.md), [`Participants`](./crisis/participants.md)

{==

The CrisisFACTS track focuses on temporal summarization for first responders in emergency situations. These summaries differ from traditional summarization in that they order information by time and produce a series of short updates instead of a longer narrative.
