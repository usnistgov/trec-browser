The database merging task also represents a focussing of the adhoc task. In this case the goal was to investigate techniques for merging results from the various TREC subcollections as opposed to treating the collections as a single entity). There were 10 subcollections defined corresponding to the various dates of the data, i.e., the three different years of the Wall Street Journal, the two different years of the AP newswire, the two sets of Ziff documents (one on each disk), and the three single subcollections (the Federal Register, the San Jose Mercury News, and the U.S. Patents). The 3 participating groups ran the adhoc topics separately on each of the 10 subcollections, merged the results, and submitted these results, along with a baseline run treating the subcollections as a single collection.
