# Overview - Filtering 1995

[`Proceedings`](./proceedings.md) | [`Data`](./data.md)

{==

The filtering track represents a variation of the routing task, and was designed to investigate concerns about the current definition of this task. It used the same topics, training documents, and test documents as the routing task. The difference was that the results submitted for the filtering runs were unranked sets of documents satisfying three 'utility function' criteria. These criteria were designed to approximate a high precision run, a high recall run, and a balanced run.
