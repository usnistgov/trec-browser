??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We present results of a study in which 50 searchers, of varying degrees of experience in information retrieval (IR), each performed searches on two TREC-4 adhoc interactive track topics, using a simple interface to the INQUERY retrieval engine. The foci of our study were: the relationships between the users' models and experience of IR, and their performance in the TREC-4 adhoc task while using a best-match IR system with relevance feedback; the understanding, use and utility of relevance feedback and ranking in interactive IR; and, the evaluation of interactive IR.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	At Georgia Tech, we investigated the effectiveness of a visualization scheme for Information Retrieval systems. Displayed like a bar-graph, the visualization tool shows the distribution of query words in the set of documents retrieved in response to a query. We found that end-users use the visualization for two purposes: to gain specific information about individual documents - such as the distribution of different query words in that document. to gain aggregate information about the query result in general - such as getting a sense of the direction of the query results. In general they used the visualization tool as much as the title and full text in the process of deciding if a document addresses the given search topic. In structured post-session interviews with searchers, we also obtained information about what the searcher liked, what was frustrating to them, and what they wanted in the system.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	City have submitted interactive runs in all the previous TRECs, with fairly undistinguished results. This time the main emphasis has been on the development of an entirely new interactive ad hoc search system (Sections 3 and Appendix). On the non-interactive side routing term selection: there has been further work on methods of selecting routing terms; manual and automatic ad hoc: the automatic ad hoc was done in more or less the same way as for TREC-3, but in view of the very brief topic statements a few runs were also done with manually edited queries.

#### Xerox Site Report: Four TREC-4 Tracks

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The Xerox research centers participated in four TREC-4 activities: the routing task, the filtering track, the Spanish track, and the interactive track. We addressed the core routing task as a problem in statistical classifica-tion: given a training set of judged documents, build an error-minimizing statistical classifier to assess the relevance of new test documents. This year, we built on the methodology developed in 21] by adding a combination strategy that pooled evidence across a number of separately trained classification schemes. Since many of our classifiers infer probability of relevance, adapting our routing methods to the filtering track consisted of obtaining probability estimates for the remaining classifiers and reporting those documents scoring above the probability thresholds determined by the three set linear utility func-tions. Our contribution to the Spanish track focussed on the effect of principled language analysis on a baseline retrieval system. We employed finite-state morphology [14] and hidden-Markov-model-based part-of-speech tagging 17] to analyze Spanish language text into canonical stemmed forms, and to identify verbs and noun phrases. Various combinations of these were then fed into SMART [1] for ranked retrieval. This year our activity on the ad hoc task focussed on the interactive track, which allows arbitrary user interaction in the process of finding relevant documents. We developed a graphical user interface to two interactive tools, Scatter/Gather [6] and Tilebars [11], and asked a number of subjects to use this tool to 'find as many good documents as you can for a topic, in around 30 minutes, without collecting too much rubbish'. We set up an experimental design to measure the value of each tool, and their combination, averaging out subject effects. That is, we were interested in determining how well the average user might perform with interactive tools rather than measuring the very best performance possible assuming an expert searcher. These efforts are described in more detail in the following sections.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We report here on our participation in the 1995 Text Retrieval (TREC 4) conference. This was limited to participation in the interactive searching task due to a re-implementation of our SPIDER retrieval system. We report on two aspects of the SPIDER system that are particularly useful for interactive searching, namely the use of fast query evaluation, and the use of passage highlighting in presenting retrieved documents to users. We also report on the lessons learned from observing people interact with our system and note the challenge faced by researchers wishing to evaluate the interactive use of information retrieval systems.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This experimental study attempts to provide a general conclusion to the Boolean information retrieval system regarding its performance on retrieval effectiveness and its behavior on retrieval of different relevant documents. Specifically a representative commercial Boolean system is compared to the best ranking systems reported in TREC4. The Boolean system delivered a comparable performance and retrieved a set of rather unique relevant docu-ments. The study also justifies its methodology for comparing non-ranking and ranking systems.
