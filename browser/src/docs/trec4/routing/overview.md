In TREC the routing task is represented by using known topics and known relevant documents for those topics, but new data for testing. The participants are given a set of known (or training) topics, along with a set of documents, including known relevant documents for those topics. The topics consist of natural language text describing a user's information need. The topics are used to create a set of queries (the actual input to the retrieval system) which are then used against the training documents.
