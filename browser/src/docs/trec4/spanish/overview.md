The multilingual track represents an extension of the adhoc task to a second language (Spanish). An informal Spanish test was run in TREC-3, but the data arrived late and few groups were able to take part. In TREC-4 the track was made official and 10 groups took part. There were about 200 megabytes of Spanish data (the El Norte newspaper from Monterey, Mexico), and 25 topics. Groups used the adhoc task guidelines, and submitted the top 1000 documents retrieved for each of the 25 Spanish topics.
