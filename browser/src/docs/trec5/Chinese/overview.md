The TREC-5 conference was the third year in which document retrieval in a language other than English was benchmarked. In TREC-3, 4 groups participated in an ad hoc retrieval task on a collection of 208 Mbytes of Mexican newspaper text in the Spanish language. In TREC-4 there were 10 groups who participated, once again in an ad hoc document retrieval task on the same Mexican newspaper texts but with new topics. In TREC-5 there was a change of document corpus and new topics for the Spanish ad hoc retrieval task and a corpus of documents and topics to support ad hoc retrieval in the Chinese language was introduced for the first time. There were 7 groups who submitted runs for the Spanish track and 10 who submitted results for Chinese.
