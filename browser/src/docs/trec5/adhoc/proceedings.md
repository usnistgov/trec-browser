??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The University of Massachusetts participated in five tracks in TREC-5: Ad-hoc, Routing, Fil-tering, Chinese, and Spanish. Our results are generally positive, continuing to indicate that the techniques we have applied perform well in a variety of settings. Significant changes in our approaches include emphasis on identifying key concepts/terms in the query topics, expansion of the query using a variant of automatic feedback called 'Local Context Analysis', and application of these techniques to a non-European language. The results show the broad applicability of Local Context Analysis, demonstrate successful identification and use of key concepts, raise interesting questions about how key concepts affect precision, support the belief that many IR techniques can be applied across languages, present an intriguing lack of tradeoff between recall and precision when filtering, and confirm once again several known results about query formulation and combination. Regrettably, three of our official submissions were marred by errors in the processing (an undetected syntax error in some queries, and an incomplete data set in an another case). The following discussion analyzes corrected runs as well as those (not particularly meaningful) submitted runs. Our experiments were conducted with version 3.1 of the INQUERY information retrieval system. INQUERY is based on the Bayesian inference network retrieval model. It is described elsewhere [5, 4, 12, 11], so this paper focuses on relevant differences to the previously published algorithms.

	The ETH group participated in this year's TREC in the following tracks: automatic adhoc (long and short), the manual adhoc, routing, and confusion. We also did some experiments on the chinese data which were not submitted. While for adhoc we relied mainly on methods which were well evaluated in previous TRECs, we successfully tried completely new techniques for the routing task and the confusion task: for routing we found an optimal feature selection method and included co-occurrence data into the retrieval function; for confusion we applied a robust probabilistic technique for estimating feature frequencies.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The Smart information retrieval project emphasizes completely automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large quantities of text. We continue our work in TREC 5, performing runs in the routing, ad-hoc, and foreign language environments. The major focus this year is on 'zoning' different parts of an initial retrieval ranking, and treating each type of query zone differently as processing continues. We also experiment with dynamic phrasing, seeing which words co-occur with original query words in documents judged relevant. Exactly the same procedure is used for foreign language environments as for English; our tenet is that good information retrieval techniques are more powerful than linguistic knowledge.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In our first participation in TREC, we focus on improving on baseline results obtained from another search engine by means of automatic query expansion. We call the specific formula we used for query 'expansion Knn re-scoring' where 'Knn' stands for 'K nearest-neighbors'. The first-pass ranking is done using Okapi system's basic scoring formula|1]. The documents are then rescored using the same formula with the top-ranked K documents as queries, weighted according to their first-pass scores. As we shall see in Sec. 5 below, the formula is motivated by viewing the rescoring process as a Markov process. This approach improves the precision substantially outside the topK retrieved documents. We have tested a variety of other techniques in trying to improving the system. These include word-sense disambiguation, passage retrieval, and document length suppression. Although they do not yield substantial or consistent improvements, some insights into search techniques can nevertheless be extracted. Our experiments are done using the short version of the ad-hoc TREC-5 queries with just the description field retained. The offical entry is submitted as ibms96a. For comparison purposes, performance on TREC-4 data and other smaller corpora are also reported here.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Queries for TREC-5 were formulated in the GCL query language using an interactive system that showed short passages containing relevant terms. Solutions to the queries were ranked by the shortest substring method introduced at TREC-4, resulting in good precision/recall performance in the adhoc and routing tasks. Performance results were found to be insensitive to a document length normalization adjustment. Shortest substring ranking was augmented by the use of a progression of successively weaker queries to improve recall, but this augmentation provided only a slight improvement to overall retrieval effectiveness.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-5 we baselined the Open Text Livelink Search Engine 6.1 and tested the use of a new automatic feedback technique against both the baseline and automatic top-document feedback. Baseline queries were created in a manner consistent with real users: small queries average 5 word), created without benefit of query execu-tion, manual feedback or external sources. The interesting results were that other similar queries used as a source of new evidence for automatic query augmentation (feed-forward returned a 38% average precision improvement over the baseline, a 12% average precision improvement over automatic top-document feedback, a 6% improvement in top-document feedback (at the 5 and 10 document levels), and was amenable to thresholding for optimal application of the technique. Automatic top-document feedback yielded nominal improvements and hurt top-document preci-sion, which is consistent with the litera-ture. Attempts to use the embedded document structure to improve search results showed no improvements, despite subjective judgments in other domains that this can be worthwhile.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Accessing online information remains an inexact science. While valuable information can be found, typically many irrelevant documents are also retrieved and many relevant ones are missed. Terminology mismatches between the user's query and document contents is a main cause of retrieval failures. Expanding a user's query with related words can improve search performance, but the problem of identifying related words remains. This research uses corpus linguistics techniques to automatically discover word similarities directly from the contents of the untagged TREC database and to incorporates that information in the SMART information retrieval system. The similarities are calculated based on the contexts in which a set of target words appear. Using these similarities, user queries are automatically expanded, resulting in conceptual retrieval rather than requiring exact word matches between queries and documents.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The Berkeley experiments for TREC-5 extend those of TREC-4 in numerous ways. For routing retrieval we experimented with the idea of term importance in three ways -- training on Boolean con-juncts of the most important terms, filtering with the most important terms, and, finally, logistic regression on presence or absence of those terms. For ad-hoc retrieval we retained the manual reformulations of the topics and experimented with negative query terms. The ad-hoc retrieval formula originally devised for TREC-2 has proven to be robust, and was used for the TREC-5 ad-hoc retrieval and for our Chinese and Spanish retrieval. Chinese retrieval was accomplished through development of a segmentation algorithm which was used to augment a Chinese dictionary. The manual query run BrklyCH2 achieved a spectacular 97.48 percent recall over the 19 queries evaluated before the conference.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC-5, we enhanced our existing prototype that implements relevance ranking using the AT&T DBC-1012 Model 4 parallel database machine to include relevance feedback. We identified SQL to compute relevance feedback and ran several experiments to identify good cutoffs for the number of documents that should be assumed to be relevant and the number of terms to add to a query. We also tried to find an optimal weighting scheme such that terms added by relevance feedback are weighted differently from those in the original query. We implemented relevance feedback in our special purpose IR prototype. Additionally, we used relevance feedback as a part of our submissions for English, Spanish, Chinese and corrupted data. Finally, we were a participant in the large data track as well. We used a text merging approach whereby a single Pentium processor was able to implement adhoc retrieval on a 4GB text collection.

	City submitted two runs each for the automatic ad hoc, very large collection track, automatic routing and Chinese track; and took part in the interactive and filtering tracks. There were no very significant new developments; the same Okapi-style weighting as in TREC-3 and TREC-4 was used this time round, although there were attempts, in the ad hoc and more notably in the Chinese experiments, to extend the weighting to cover searches containing both words and phrases. All submitted runs except for the Chinese incorporated run-time passage determination and searching. The Okapi back-end search engine has been considerably speeded, and a few new functions incorporated. See Section 3.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A number of experiments conducted within the framework of the TREC-5 conference and using the Parallel Document Retrieval Engine (PADRE) are reported. Several of the experiments involve the use of distance-based relevance scoring (spans). This scoring method is shown to be capable of very good precision-recall performance, provided that good queries can be generated. Semi-automatic methods for refining manually-generated span queries are described and evaluated in the context of the adhoc retrieval task. Span queries are also applied to processing a larger (4.5 gigabyte) collection, to retrieval over OCR-corrupted data and to a database merging task. Lightweight probe queries are shown to be an effective method for identifying promising information servers in the context of the latter task. New techniques for automatically generating more conventional weighted-term queries from short topic descriptions have also been devised and are evaluated.

	In this paper we discuss Bayesian network implementation for retrieving documents in a text database. We participate in TREC-5 for ad-hoc task in category B. Several problems and possible solutions in implementing large scale text retrieval system using Bayesian network are discussed The main problems are the existence of loop and large number of parents per-node. The solutions suggested are that of intelligence node and virtual layer. Comparison with other Bayesian approach to text retrieval is also discussed. We shows that our approach gives more correct semantic to the retrieval model.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Our research for TREC5 focused on search and retrieval of full-text documents with short natural language (NL) queries. It has been our strong belief that the queries submitted to any operational retrieval system, especially those on the Internet, are short or very short, and that an effective approach to processing short NL queries has great application poten-tial. We also looked at data fusion [1] with the assumption that a number of well-devel-oped and specialized retrieval functions would probably outperform a single well-developed but general function. For example, two functions, one specialized in retrieving medium to long documents and another short to medium documents, would deliver better performance if they could be combined properly. Finally, we investigated the problem of selecting documents for relevance feedback. Unhappy with the assumption that all of the top 20 retrieved documents, for example, are relevant and ready for a relevance feedback process, we revisited the cluster hypothesis [2] and experimented with clustering the top 20 documents and automatically selecting a subset for relevance feedback. Our research system named EUREKA (End User Research Enquiry and Knowledge Acquisition) was used for carrying out the experiments. EUREKA consists of a rich set of UNIX tools which can be assembled into various automatic indexing and ranking/filtering mechanisms, either as a new retrieval system or as a simulation of an interesting research system. The tool set design provides a maximum level of flexibility. The remaining document is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a strategy for processing short NL queries and reports experiment results. Section 3 describes a strategy for data fusion and presents related experimental results. Section 4 describes a selective relevance feedback process and discusses related experimental results. Note that every experiment reported in these sections used the TREC4 ad hoc data and queries--our training materials for preparing for TREC5. Section 5 summarizes the training work. And finally, Section 6 comments on our TREC5 results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper we describe work done as part of the TREC-5 benchmarking exercise by a team from Dublin City University. In TREC-5 we had three activities as follows: Our ad hoc submissions employ Query Space Reduction techniques which attempt to minimise the amount of data processed by an IR search engine during the retrieval process. We submitted four runs for evaluation, two automatic and two manual with one automatic run and one manual run employing our Query Space Reduction techniques. The paper reports our findings in terms of retrieval effectiveness and also in terms of the savings we make in execution time. Our submission to the multi-lingual track (Spanish) in TREC-5 involves evaluating the performance of a new stemming algorithm for Spanish developed by Martin Porter. We submitted three runs for evaluation, two automatic, and one manual, involving a manual expansion from retrieved documents. Character shape coding (CSC) is a technique for representing scanned text using a much reduced alphabet. It has been developed by Larry Spitz of Daimler Benz as an alternative to full-scale OCR for paper documents. Some of our TREC-5 experiments have started evaluating the performance of a CSC representation of scanned documents for information retrieval and this paper outlines our future work in this area

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Two English automatic ad-hoc runs have been submitted: pircsAAS uses short and pircsAAL employs long topics. Our new avtf*ildf term weighting was used for short queries. 2-stage retrieval were performed. Both automatic runs are much better than the overall automatic average. Two manual runs are based on short topics: pircAM1 employs double weighting for user-selected query terms and pircs AM2 additionally extends these queries with new terms chosen manually. They perform about average compared with the the overall manual runs. Our two Chinese automatic ad-hoc runs are: pircsCw, using short-word segmentation for Chinese texts and piresCwc, which additionally includes single characters. Both runs are much better than average, but pircsCwe has a slight edge over pircsCw. In routing a genetic algorithm is used to select suitable subsets of relevant documents for training queries. Out of an initial random population of 15, the best subset (based on average precision) was employed to train the routing queries for the pircsRGO run. This ith (= 0) population is operated by a probabilistic reproduction and crossover strategy to produce the (i+1)th and evaluated, and this iterates for 6 generations. The best relevant subset of the 6th is used for training our queries for pircsRG6. It performs a few percent better than pircsRGO, and both are well above average. For the filtering experiment, we use thresholding on the retrieval status values; thresholds are trained based on the utility functions. Results are also good.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper mainly discusses the efficiency of PFIRE sys-tem, a parallel VSM-based text retrieval system running on the GCel3/512 Parsytec machine, as well as the effectiveness of the corresponding pre-existing serial FIRE system. Concerning PFIRE, the use of suitable data sharing and load balancing techniques in combination with specific pipelining techniques and with the capability of building binary and fat-tree virtual topologies over the 2-D mesh physical interconnection network of the parallel machine, leads to very fast interactive searching over the large scale TREC collections. Analytical and experimental evidence is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques. The corresponding conventional FIRE system was also used to measure the effectiveness (in terms of recall and precission) of several IR techniques (statistical phrase indexing, automatic statistical global thesaurus construction etc.) used over the TREC WSJ subcollection.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In our first participation in TREC, we focus on improving on baseline results obtained from another search engine by means of automatic query expansion. We call the specific formula we used for query 'expansion Knn re-scoring' where 'Knn' stands for 'K nearest-neighbors'. The first-pass ranking is done using Okapi system's basic scoring formula|1]. The documents are then rescored using the same formula with the top-ranked K documents as queries, weighted according to their first-pass scores. As we shall see in Sec. 5 below, the formula is motivated by viewing the rescoring process as a Markov process. This approach improves the precision substantially outside the topK retrieved documents. We have tested a variety of other techniques in trying to improving the system. These include word-sense disambiguation, passage retrieval, and document length suppression. Although they do not yield substantial or consistent improvements, some insights into search techniques can nevertheless be extracted. Our experiments are done using the short version of the ad-hoc TREC-5 queries with just the description field retained. The offical entry is submitted as ibms96a. For comparison purposes, performance on TREC-4 data and other smaller corpora are also reported here.

We discuss the phenomenon of very short queries generated by users of interactive search services, and summarize a new technique we are using in V-Twin to handle these queries more effectively. We then present some results based on V-Twin's performance at the TREC-5 ad hoc task. V-Twin achieved a high level of performance despite having much lower index overhead and memory footprint than other systems participating in TREC.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year's submission from the Glasgow IR group (glair4) is to the category B automatic ad hoc section. Due to pressures of time and unexpected complications, our intended application of a technique known as generalised imaging [Crestani 95] was not completed in time for the TREC deadline. Therefore, the submission is the output of an IR system running a simplistic retrieval strategy, similar to last year's submission though with some intended improvements. It would appear from comparison with other category B submissions that this strategy is relatively successful. The following sections of this report contain a description of the retrieval strategy used, a analysis of the results, and finally, a discussion of our intentions for TREC 6.

	This paper summarizes the results of the experiments conducted by FS Consulting, Inc. as part of the Fifth Text Retrieval Experiment Conference (TREC-5). We participated in Category C, ran the ad-hoc experiments and participated in the database merging track, producing three sets of official results (fsclt, fsclt and fsclt3m) as well as some unofficial results (fsclta). Our long-term research interest is in building information retrieval systems that help users find information to solve real-world problems. Our TREC-5 participation centered on two goals: to see if automatic query reformulation (relevance feedback) provides better results than the searcher's query reformulation; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the document scoring algorithms when searching across multiple databases. Our TREC-5 ad-hoc experiments were designed around a model of an experienced end user of information systems, one who might regularly use a system like the MPS Information Server while seeking information in a workplace or library setting

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper we report on the joint GE/Lockheed Martin/Rutgers/NYU natural language information retrieval project as related to the 5th Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-5). The main thrust of this project is to use natural language processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of full-text document retrieval. Since our first TREC entry in 1992 (as NYU team) the basic premise of our research was to demonstrate that robust if relatively shallow NLP can help to derive a better representation of text documents for statistical search. TREC-5 marks a shift in this approach away from text representation issues and towards query development problems. While our TREC-5 system still performs extensive text processing in order to extract phrasal and other indexing terms, our main focus this year was on query construction using words, sentences, and entire passages to expand initial topic specifications in an attempt to cover their various angles, aspects and contexts. Based on our earlier TREC results indicating that NLP is more effective when long, descriptive queries are used, we allowed for liberal expansion with long passages from related documents imported verbatim into the queries. This method appears to have produced a dramatic improvement in the performance of two different statistical search engines that we tested (Cornell's SMART and NIST's Prise) boosting the average precision by at least 40%. The overall architecture of TREC-5 system has also changed in a number of ways from TREC-4. The most notable new feature is the stream architecture in which several independent, parallel indexes are built for a given collection, each index reflecting a different representation strategy for text documents. Stream indexes are built using a mixture of different indexing approaches, term extracting, and weighting strategies. We used both SMART and Prise base indexing engines, and selected optimal term weighting strategies for each stream, based on a training collection of approximately 500 MBytes. The final results are produced by a merging procedure that combines ranked list of documents obtained by searching all stream indexes with appropriately preprocessed queries. This allows for an effective combination of alternative retrieval and filtering methods, creating into a meta-search where the contribution of each stream can be optimized through training.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The SMART system (v. 11.0) was used as a front-end to a two-stage retrieval process. In the first stage, (WSJ documents and the description field of (ad hoc) topics were indexed by the stems of single terms; Inc and It weights were computed for word stems in documents and queries, respectively; and documents were ranked according to the cosine similarity of document and query vectors. Related by the initial query vector, the first 5000 documents in the ranked list for each topic constituted a 'condensed' database for that topic. Preliminary experiments with TREC-4 topics and official relevance evaluations suggested each such database would include a high fraction of relevant documents for the associated topic, and the result was confirmed by TREC-S results. In the second stage, initial query vectors were automatically refined by two relevance feedback strategies applied to the condensed databases. One of us employed the adaptive linear model (uncis/), and the other used a variation of the 'classic' probabilistic model (uncis2); relevance judgments were made independently. In uncisi, the query at a given search iteration is expanded by all terms in relevant, retrieved documents and all terms in selected, nonrelevant, retrieved documents, and documents are ranked by the inner product of document and query vectors. In uncis2, the query is expanded by all terms in relevant, retrieved documents, and documents are ranked by the cosine similarity of document and query vectors. For uncisI and uncis2, respectively, average non-interpolated precision values over all relevant documents are 0.25 and 0.20, and average R-precision values are 0.25 and 0.21. Results show that independent relevance judgments made in uncis and uncis are quite different and have a strong effect on retrieval outcomes; our relevance evaluations also differ significantly from official relevance judgments. Retrieval performance improves when official relevance judgments are utilized by both models. For the 31 topics in which there was an official relevant document in the top 34 of the initial ranking, average non-interpolated precision values are 0.60 for the adaptive linear model and 0.59 for the probabilistic model.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A linear mixture of experts is used to combine three standard IR systems. The parameters for the mixture are determined automatically through training on document relevance assessments via optimization of a rank-order statistic which is empirically correlated with average precision. The mixture improves performance in some cases and degrades it in others, with the degradations possibly due to training techniques, model strength, and poor performance of the individual experts.
