 For TREC-5, retrieval from corrupted data was studied through retrieval of single target  documents from a corpus which was corrupted by producing page images, corrupting the bit  maps, and applying OCR techniques to the results. In general, methods which attempted a probabilistic estimation of the original clean text fare better than methods which simply accept corrupted versions of the query text.
