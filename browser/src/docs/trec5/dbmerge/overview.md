There are many times when users want to search separate text collections as if they were a single collection. For example, computer networks can provide access to a variety of corpora that are owned and maintained by different entities. Instead of issuing search commands to each of the databases in turn and manually collating the individual results, users prefer a mechanism for performing a single, integrated search. In other cases, reliability and efficiency concerns may dictate that databases that are under the same administrative control should be physically separate. Again, users want to issue a single search request that returns an integrated result. The database merging track investigates methods for combining the results of separate searches into a single, cohesive result.
