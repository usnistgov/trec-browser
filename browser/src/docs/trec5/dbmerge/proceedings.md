??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	There are many times when users want to search separate text collections as if they were a single collection. For example, computer networks can provide access to a variety of corpora that are owned and maintained by different entities. Instead of issuing search commands to each of the databases in turn and manually collating the individual results, users prefer a mechanism for performing a single, integrated search. In other cases, reliability and efficiency concerns may dictate that databases that are under the same administrative control should be physically separate. Again, users want to issue a single search request that returns an integrated result. The database merging track investigates methods for combining the results of separate searches into a single, cohesive result.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A number of experiments conducted within the framework of the TREC-5 conference and using the Parallel Document Retrieval Engine (PADRE) are reported. Several of the experiments involve the use of distance-based relevance scoring (spans). This scoring method is shown to be capable of very good precision-recall performance, provided that good queries can be generated. Semi-automatic methods for refining manually-generated span queries are described and evaluated in the context of the adhoc retrieval task. Span queries are also applied to processing a larger (4.5 gigabyte) collection, to retrieval over OCR-corrupted data and to a database merging task. Lightweight probe queries are shown to be an effective method for identifying promising information servers in the context of the latter task. New techniques for automatically generating more conventional weighted-term queries from short topic descriptions have also been devised and are evaluated.
