{==

The TREC-5 filtering track, an evaluation of binary text classification systems, was a repeat of the filtering evaluation run in a trial version for TREC-4, with only the data set and participants changing. Seven sites took part, submitting a total of ten runs. We review the nature of the task, the effectiveness measures and evaluation methods used, and briefly discuss the results. Some deficiencies in the evaluation are examined, with an eye toward improving future filtering evaluations.
