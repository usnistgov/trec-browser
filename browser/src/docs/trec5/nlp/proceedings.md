??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	NLP track has been organized for the first time at TREC-5 to provide a more focused look at how NLP techniques can help in achieving better performance in information retrieval. The intent was to see if NLP techniques available today are mature enough to have an impact on IR, specifically if and when they can offer an advantage over purely quantitative methods. This was also a place to try some more expensive and more risky solutions than those used in main TREC evaluations.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Existing work on indexing and retrieving documents from large on-line collections has had great success at treating both documents and queries as simple, unstructured collections of individual words (terms) with dependencies among these terms largely ignored. However, natural language text has a great deal of structure. In particular, at a scale close to that of the individual word, there are interactions and dependencies that many IR systems ignore. Those systems that do attempt to capture some of these dependencies do so in rather indirect ways. MITRE has substantial experience with trainable natural language algorithms, and we believe this powerful approach is complimentary to the standard information retrieval paradigm. Developed over a number of years, our technology has been used to good effect in the context of information extraction tasks, such as the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) [1]. Because our approach is based on automatically training our NLP components on large data sets, resulting in accurate and very fast text processors, and because we believe that empirical evaluation is highly important, we have been interested in classical information retrieval for some time. Our first foray into TREC was begun to explore the possibility of improving IR systems with this technology.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Xerox participated in TREC 5 through experiments carried out separately and conjointly at the Rank Xerox Research Centre (RXRC) in Grenoble and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center The remainder of this report is divided into three sections. The first section describes our work on routing and filtering (Hull, Schütze, and Pedersen), the second section covers the NLP track (Grefenstette, Schulze, and Gaussier), and the final section addresses the Spanish track (Grefenstette, Schulze, and Hull).
