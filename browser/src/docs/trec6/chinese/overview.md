The TREC-6 conference was the fourth year in which document retrieval in a language other than English was carried out. In TREC-3, 4 groups participated in an ad hoc retrieval task on a collection of 208 Mbytes of Mexican newspaper text in the Spanish language. In TREC-4 there were 10 groups who participated, once again in an ad hoc document retrieval task on the same Mexican newspaper texts but with new topics. In TREC-5 there was a change of document corpus and new topics for the Spanish ad hoc retrieval task and a corpus of documents and topics to support ad hoc retrieval in the Chinese language was introduced for the first time. In TREC-6 there was two tracks in which languages other than English were explored. In the Chinese track, a second set of topics were evaluated against the existing corpus. In the cross-lingual track experiments were conducted where queries in one language were used against a document corpus in another language. This report concentrates solely on the Chinese track.
