Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) was a new task in the TREC-6 evaluation. In contrast to the multilingual track included in previous TREC evaluations, which was concerned with information retrieval in Spanish or Chi-nese, the cross-language retrieval track focuses on the retrieval situation where the documents are written in a language which is different than the language used to specify the queries. The TREC-6 track used documents in English, French and German and queries in English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch.
