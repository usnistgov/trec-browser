The High-Precision Track is a new track for TREC. It has a very simple short description: for each query, a user should find the best 10 documents possible within 5 minutes clock time. One realistic scenario corresponding to this task might be that your boss asks you for a quick report on some area and you need to find some information on the area fast.
