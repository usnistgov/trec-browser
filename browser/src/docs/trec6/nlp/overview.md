{==

The NLP track was initiated to explore whether the natural language processing (NLP) techniques available today are mature enough to have an impact on IR, and specifically whether they can offer an advantage over purely quantitative retrieval methods. The track used the 50 ad hoc topics and the Financial Times document set.
