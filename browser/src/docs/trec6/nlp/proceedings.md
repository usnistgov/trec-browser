??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Natural language processing techniques may hold a tremendous potential for overcoming the inadequacies of purely quantitative methods of text information retrieval, but the empirical evidence to support such predictions has thus far been inadequate, and appropriate scale evaluations have been slow to emerge. In this chapter, we report on the progress of the Natural Language Information Retrieval project, a joint effort of several sites led by GE Research, and its evaluation in the 6th Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC-6).

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper contains a description of the methodology and results of the three TREC submissions made by the Glasgow IR group (glair). In addition to submitting to the ad hoc task, submissions were also made to NLP track and to the SDR speech 'pre-track'. Results from our submissions reveal that some of our approaches have performed poorly (i.e. ad hoc and NLP track), but we have also had success particularly in the speech track through use of transcript merging. We also highlight and discuss a seemingly unusual result where retrieval based on the very short versions of the TREC ad hoc queries produced better retrieval effectiveness than retrieval based on more 'normal' length queries.
