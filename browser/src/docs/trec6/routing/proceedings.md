??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The filtering work was essentially only a small extension of the routing task effort. The pool of merged routing queries was used, but query selection was based on maximizing (over the training data) each of the utility functions for each topic. Two triples of runs were submitted. Both these sets compared very favourably with other participants' results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A linear combination of scores from two different IR systems is used for the routing task, with one combination model being trained for each query. Despite a poor selection of component systems, the combination model performs on par with the better of the two systems, learning to ignore the worse system.

	The Verity Trec-6 entry focused on the performance of the built-in search facilities of the commercially available Verity engine and explored the impact of simple enhancements. The ad hoc results show that considerable improvements can be achieved through the application of standard and more experimental techniques. The routing results show that respectable performance can be achieved simply through careful parameter tuning.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The technique described in this paper is similar to latent semantic indexing (LSI), although with some variation. Whereas LSI operates by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) on a large term by document matrix of co-occurrence scores, the technique here operates by identifying eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a term by term matrix of correlation scores (derived from co-occurrence scores). The technique of identifying eigenvectors and eigenvalues from a correlation matrix is known as principal components analysis (PCA). Variations from the previous year's TREC work include work using sub-documents (paragraphs), and working with small sub-matrices consisting only of terms in a query, rather than working with all terms from the collection.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	ETH Zurich's participation in TREC-6 consists of experiments in the main routing task, both manual and automatic runs in the Chinese retrieval track, cross-language retrieval in each of German, French and English as part of the new cross-language retrieval track, and experiments in speech recognition and retrieval under the new spoken document retrieval track. This year our routing experiments focused on the improvement of the feature selection strategy, on query expansion using similarity thesauri, on the grouping of features and on the combination of different retrieval methods. For Chinese retrieval we continued to rely on character bi-grams for indexing instead of attempting to segment and identify individual words, and we introduced a new manually-constructed stopword list consisting of almost 1,000 Chinese words. Experiments in cross-language retrieval focused heavily on our approach using multilingual similarity thesauri but also included several runs using machine translation technol-ogy. Finally, for the spoken document retrieval track our work included the development of a simple speaker-independent phoneme recogniser and some innovations in our probabilistic retrieval functions to compensate for speech recognition errors.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Recently, we studied the method of extracting terms that co-occurred with initial query terms in relevant paragraphs as query term expansion method. In our methods, paragraphs in the relevant documents are lanked by using initial query to extract terms from the upper ranked paragraphs with using term co-occurrence. Our method eases the difficulty by ranking paragraphs with the initial query. Without using term co-occurrence in paragraphs, we could achieve the highly accurate treatment of term co-occurrence by small calculation. The results of our system for TREC-6 routing test data, obtained by using the expanded queries generated by our query term generation method are compared with the results obtained by initial queries.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The MultiText system retrieves passages, rather than entire documents, that are likely to be relevant to a particular topic. For all runs, we used the reciprocal of the length of each passage as an estimate of its likely relevance and ranked accordingly. For the manual adhoc task we explored the limits of user interaction by judging some 13,000 documents based on retrieved passages. For the automatic adhoc task we used retrieved passages as a feedback source for new query terms. For the routing task we estimated probability of relevance from passage length and used this estimate to construct a compound (tiered) query which was used to rank the new data using passage length. For the Chinese track we indexed individual characters rather than segmented words or bigrams and used manually constructed queries and passage-length ranking. For the high precision track we performed judgements on passages using an interface similar to that used for the manual adhoc task. The Very Large Collection run was done on a network of four cheap computers using very simple manually constructed queries and passage-length ranking.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The Smart information retrieval project emphasizes completely automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large quantities of text. We continue our work in TREC 6, performing runs in the routing, ad-hoc, and foreign language environments, including cross-lingual runs. The major focus this year is on trying to maintain the balance of the query - attempting to ensure the various aspects of the original query are appropriately addressed, especially while adding expansion terms. Exactly the same procedure is used for foreign language environments as for English; our tenet is that good information retrieval techniques are more powerful than linguistic knowledge. We also give an interesting cross-lingual run, assuming that French and English are closely enough related so that a query in one language can be run directly on a collection in the other language by just 'correcting' the spelling of the query words. This is quite successful for most queries.

	Our approach to TREC6 has explored the possibility of building complex Boolean expressions which represent the classificatory information present in the training data. The positive (i.e. judged relevant), and negative (i.e. judged not relevant) documents are studied separately, using Church's measure of 'non-Poissonicity' (Church & Gale, 1995) to identify promising terms for classification. In the official runs, statistics are produced using the MG (Witten, Moffat, Bell, 1994)) search engine, and the terms are in fact stems, rather than complete terms. The top 25 terms selected from the positive and negative examples are merged, to form a list with no more than 50 terms. The MG retrieval system is used (massively) to transform every judged document into a Boolean vector with one component for each distinct classification term. The RUTCOR LAD program (Boros, Hammer, Ibaraki, Kogan, Mayoraz, & Muchnik, 1996) is used (twice for each topic), with several modifications, to search exhaustively for Boolean prime implicants which characterize the positive and the negative examples. Due to computer speed limitations, we have limited the search in our official submissions to terms of order three (i.e terms such as ABC', where C' denotes the absence of term C). Each pattern which matches some positive (respectively, negative) examples is given a weight determined by the number of examples that it matches.

#### Using Information Extraction to Improve Document Retrieval

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We describe an approach to applying a particular kind of Natural Language Processing (NLP) system to the TREC routing task in Information Retrieval (IR). Rather than attempting to use NLP techniques in indexing documents in a corpus, we adapted an information extraction (IE) system to act as a post-filter on the output of an IR system. The IE system was configured to score each of the top 2000 documents as determined by an IR system and on the basis of that score to rerank those 2000 documents. One aim was to improve precision on routing tasks. Another was to make it easier to write IE grammars for multiple topics.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The retrieval approach is based on vector representation (bag of character strings), on dimension reduction (LSI - latent semantic indexing) and on statistical machine learning techniques in all processing levels. Two phases are distinguished, the adaptation phase based on training samples (texts) and the application phase, where each text is mapped to one or more categories (classes). The adaptation process is corpus dependent and automatic and, hence, domain and language independent. The main idea of this approach is to generate different sets of simple features which represent different views to texts. For each text to be filtered/ routed, different feature vectors are generated and classified into a decision vector which contains estimates of class membership probabilities. In the following step, these decision vectors are regarded as feature vectors and fed to another classifier that combines these set of decision vectors into the final one.

#### INQUERY Does Battle With TREC-6

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in eight of the ten tracks that were part of the TREC-6 workshop. We started with the two required tracks, ad-hoc and routing, but then included VLC, Filtering, Chinese, Cross-language, SDR, and Interactive. We omitted NLP and High Precision for want of time and energy. With so many tracks involved, it is nearly inevitable that something will go wrong. Despite our best efforts at verifying all aspects of each track-before, during, and after the experiments we once again made mistakes that were minor in scope, but major in consequence. Those mistakes affected our results in Ad-hoc and Routing, as well as the dependent tracks of VLC and Filtering. The details of the mistakes are presented in each track's discussion, along with information comparing the submitted runs to the corrected runs. Unfortunately, those corrected runs are not included in TREC-6 summary information. This remainder of this report covers our approach to each of the tracks as well as some experimental results and analysis. We start with an overview of the major tools that were used across all tracks. The paper is divided into the following sections. The track descriptions are generally broken into approach, results, and analysis sections, though some tracks require a different description.
