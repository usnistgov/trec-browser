Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) involves the retrieval of excerpts from recordings of speech using a combination of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval techniques. In performing SDR, a speech recognition engine is applied to an audio input stream and generates a time-marked textual representation (transcription) of the speech. The transcription is then indexed and may be searched using an Information Retrieval engine.
