[`Proceedings`](./proceedings.md)

{==

The emergence of real world applications for text collections orders of magnitude larger than the TREC collection has motivated the introduction of a Very Large Collection track within the TREC framework. The 20 gigabyte data set developed for the track is char-acterised, track objectives and guidelines are summarised and the measures employed are described. The contribution of the organizations which made data available is gratefully acknowledged and an overview is given of the track participants, the methods used and the results obtained. Alternative options for the future of the track are discussed.
