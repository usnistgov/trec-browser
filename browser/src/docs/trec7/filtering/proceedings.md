??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This article describes the experiments conducted in the TREC-7 filtering track, which consisted of three subtasks: adaptive filtering, batch filtering, and routing. The focus this year is on adaptive filtering, where the system begins with only the topic statement and must interactively adjust a filtering profile constructed from that topic in response to on-line feedback. In addition to motivating the task and describing the practical details of participating in the track, this document includes a detailed graphical presentation of the experimental results and provides a brief overall analysis of the performance data.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in only four of the tracks that were part of the TREC-7 workshop. We worked on ad-hoc retrieval, filtering, VLC, and the SDR track. This report covers the work done on each track successively. We start with a discussion of IR tools that were broadly applied in our work.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The tests we performed for TREC-7 were focused on automatic ad hoc and filtering tasks. With regard to the automatic ad hoc task we assessed two query modification strategies. Both were based on blind relevance feedback processes. The first one carried on with the TREC6 tests: new parameter values of the relevance backpropagation formulas have been tuned. On the other hand, we proposed a new query modification strategy that uses a text mining approach. Three runs were sent. We sent two runs for the relevance backpropagation strategy: one used long topics (titles, descriptions and narratives) and the other one used titles and descriptions. We sent one run for the text mining strategy using long topics. With regard to the filtering task, we sent runs in batch filtering and routing using both relevance backpropagation and gradient neural backpropagation.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Information filtering is increasingly critical to knowledge workers drowning in a growing flood of byte streams [6, 8, 9]. Our interest in the filtering track for TREC-7 grew out of work originally designed for information retrieval on the Web, using both 'traditional' search engine [5] and agent-based techniques [6, 7]. In particular, the work by Cutter, et. al. in clustering [3, 4] has great appeal in the potential for synergistic interaction between user and retrieval system. Our efforts for TREC-7 included two distinct filtering architectures, as well as a more traditional approach to the adhoc track (which used SMART 11.3). The filtering work was done using TRECcer - our Java-based clustering environment - alone for adaptive filtering and a combination of TRECcer and SMART for batch filtering.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we describe the system and methods used for the CLARITECH entries in the TREC-7 Filtering Track. Our main aim was to study algorithms, designs, and parameters for Adaptive Filtering, as this comes closest to actual applications. For efficiency's sake, however, we adapted a system largely geared towards retrieval and introduced a few critical new components. The first of these components, the delivery ratio mechanism, is used to obtain a profile threshold when no feedback has been received. A second method, which we call beta gamma regulation, is used for threshold updating. It takes into account the number of judged documents processed by the system as well as an expected bias in optimal threshold calculation. Several parameters were determined empirically: apart from the parameters pertaining to the new components, we also experimented with different choices for the reference corpus, and different 'chunk' sizes for processing news stories. Gradually increasing chunk sizes over 'time' appears to help profile learning. Finally, we examined the effect of terminating underperforming queries over the AP90 corpus and found that the utility metric over AP88-AP89 was a good predictor. All of the above innovations contributed to the success of the CLARITECH system in the adaptive filtering track.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year AT&T participated in the ad-hoc task and the Filtering, SDR, and VLC tracks. Most of our effort for TREC-T was concentrated on SDR and VLC tracks. On the filtering track, we tested a preliminary version of a text classification toolkit that we have been developing over the last year. In the ad-hoc task, we introduce a new tf-factor in our term weighting scheme and use a simplified retrieval algorithm. The same weighting scheme and algorithm are used in the SDR and the VLC tracks. The results from the SDR track show that retrieval from automatic transcriptions of speech is quite competitive with doing retrieval from human transcriptions. Our experiments indicate that document expansion can be used to further improve retrieval from automatic transcripts. Results of filtering track are in line with our expectations given the early developmental stage of our classification software. The results of VLC track do not support our hypothesis that retrieval lists from a distributed search can be effectively merged using only the initial part of the documents.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year saw a major departure from the previous Okapi approach to routing and filtering. We concentrated our efforts on the twin problems of (a) starting from scratch, with no assumed history of relevance judgments for each topic, and (b) having to define a threshold for retrieval. The thresholding problem is interesting and difficult; we associate it with the problem of assigning an explicit estimate of the probability of relevance to each document. We describe and test a set of methods for initializing the profile for each threshold and for modifying it as time passes. Two pairs of runs were submitted: in one pair queries remained constant, but in the other query terms were reweighted when fresh relevance information became available.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in the main task of automatic ad-hoc retrieval as well as the high precision and filtering tracks. For ad-hoc, three experiments were done with query types of short (title section of a topic), medium (description section) and long (all sections) lengths. We used a sequence of five methods to handle the short and medium length queries. For long queries we employed a re-ranking method based on evidence from matching query phrases in document windows in both stages of a 2-stage retrieval. Results are well above median. For high precision track, we employed our interactive PIRCS system for the first time. In adaptive filtering, we concentrate on dynamically varying the retrieval status value threshold for deciding selection and during the course of filtering. Query weights were trained but expansion was not done. We also submitted results for batch filtering and standard routing based on methods evolved from previous TREC experiments.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-T, we participated in the ad-hoc task (main task) and the filtering track (sub task). In the ad-hoc task, we adopted a scoring method that used co-occurrence term relations in a document and specific processing in order to determine which conceptual parts of the documents should be targeted for query expansion. In filtering, we adopted a machine-readable dictionary for detecting idioms and an inductive learning algorithm for detecting important co-occurrences of terms. In this paper, we describe the system approach and discuss the evaluation results in brief for our ad-hoc and filtering in TREC-7.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper presents work done at Cambridge University, on the TREC-7 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) Track. The broadcast news audio was transcribed using a 2-pass gender-dependent HTK speech recog-niser which ran at 50 times real time and gave an overall word error rate of 24.8%, the lowest in the track. The Okapi-based retrieval engine used in TREC-6 by the City/Cambridge University collaboration was supplemented by improving the stop-list, adding a bad-spelling mapper and stemmer exceptions list, adding word-pair information, integrating part-of-speech weighting on query terms and including some pre-search statistical expansion. The final system gave an average precision of 0.4817 on the reference and 0.4509 on the automatic tran-scription, with the R-precision being 0.4603 and 0.4330 respectively. The paper also presents results on a new set of 60 queries with assessments for the TREC-6 test document data used for development pur-poses, and analyses the relationship between recognition accuracy, as defined by a pre-processed term error rate, and retrieval performance for both sets of data.
