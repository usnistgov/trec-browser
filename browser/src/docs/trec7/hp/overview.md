TREC 7 is the second year the High-Precision (HP) track has been run. It is an attempt to perform a task that is much more closely related to real-world user interactions than the ad-hoc or routing task. The goal is simple: a user is asked to find 15 relevant documents in 5 minutes. No other restrictions are put on the user (other than no prior knowledge of the query, and no asking other users for help). Official evaluation is simply how many actual relevant documents were found among the 15 documents supplied by the user, modified slightly for those queries with fewer than 15 relevant documents in the collection (Relative Precision at 15 documents).
