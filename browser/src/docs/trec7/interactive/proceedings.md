??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This report is an introduction to the work of the TREC-7 Interactive Track with its goal of investigating interactive information retrieval by examining the process as well as the results. Eight research groups ran a total of 15 interactive information retrieval (IR) systems on a shared prob-lem: a question-answering task, eight statements of information need, and a collection of 210,158 articles from the Financial Times of London 1991-1994. This report summarizes the shared experimental framework, which for TREC-7 was designed to support analysis and comparison of system performance only within sites. The report refers the reader to separate discussions of the experiments performed by each participating group - their hypotheses, experimental systems, and results. The papers from each of the participating groups and the raw and evaluated results are available via the TREC home page (trec.nist.gov).

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We present results of a study comparing two different interactive information retrieval systems: one which supports positive relevance feedback as a term-suggestion device; the other which supports both positive and negative relevance feedback in this same context. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and usability of a specific implementation of negative relevance feedback in interactive information retrieval. A second purpose was to investigate the effectiveness and usability of relevance feedback implemented as a term-suggestion device. The results suggest that, although there was no benefit in terms of performance for the system with negative and positive relevance feedback, this might be due to specific implementation issues.

	Two pairwise comparisons were made: Okapi with relevance feedback against Okapi without, and Okapi without against ZPrise without. Okapi without performed somewhat worse than ZPrise, and Okapi with only partially recovered the deficit.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Experiments are presented based on unofficial results for TREC-7. Eigensystems analysis of a term co-occurrence matrix is compared to eigensystems analysis of a term correlation matrix. For each matrix type, the effect of term weighting and document length normalization is assessed. Recall-precision curves and other TREC statistics indicate that the use of the correlation matrix improves performance regardless of what term weighting or document length normalization is used.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Studies comparing Boolean and natural language searching with actual end-users are still inconclusive. The TREC interactive track provides a consensus-developed protocol for assessing this and other user-oriented information retrieval research questions. We recruited 28 experienced information professionals with library degrees to participate in this year's TREC-7 interactive experiment. Our results showed that this was a highly experienced group of searchers who performed equally well with both types of systems.

- :material-file-search: **Runs:** [C-Z](./runs.md#c-z)

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC-7, the Berkeley ad-hoc experiments explored more phrase discovery in topics and documents. We utilized Boolean retrieval combined with probabilistic ranking for 17 topics in ad-hoc manual entry. Our cross-language experiments tested 3 different widely available machine translation software packages. For language pairs (e.g. German to French) for which no direct machine translation was available we made use of English as a universal intermediate language. For CLIR we also manually reformulated the English topics before doing machine translation, and this elicited a significant performance increase for both quad language retrieval and for English against English and French documents. In our Interactive Track entry eight searchers conducted eight searches each, half on the Cheshire II system and the other half on the Zprise system, for a total of 64 searches. Questionnaires were administered to gather information about basic demographic and searching experience, about each search, about each of the systems, and finally, about the user's perceptions of the systems.
