??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The seventh Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-7) was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on November 9-11, 1998. The conference was co-sponsored by NIST and the Information Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as part of the TIPSTER Text Program. TREC-7 is the latest in a series of workshops designed to foster research in text retrieval. For analyses of the results of previous workshops, see Sparck Jones (7), Tague-Sutcliffe and Blustein [9], and Harman [2]. In addition, the overview paper in each of the previous TREC proceedings summarizes the results of that TREC. The TREC workshop series has the following goals: to encourage research in text retrieval based on large test collections; to increase communication among industry, academia, and government by creating an open forum for the exchange of research ideas; to speed the transfer of technology from research labs into commercial products by demonstrating substantial improvements in retrieval methodologies on real-world problems; and to increase the availability of appropriate evaluation techniques for use by industry and academia, including development of new evaluation techniques more applicable to current systems. Table 1 lists the groups that participated in TREC-7. Fifty-six groups including participants from 13 different countries and 19 companies were represented. The diversity of the participating groups has ensured that TREC represents many different approaches to text retrieval. The emphasis on individual experiments evaluated within a common setting has proven to be a major strength of TREC. This paper serves as an introduction to the research described in detail in the remainder of the volume. It concentrates mainly on the main task, ad hoc retrieval, which is defined the next section. Details regarding the test collections and evaluation methodology used in TREC follow in sections 3 and 4, while section 5 provides an overview of the ad hoc retrieval results. In addition to the main ad hoc task, TREC-7 contained seven 'tracks', tasks that focus research on particular subproblems of text retrieval. Taken together, the tracks represent the bulk of the experiments performed in TREC-7. However, each track has its own overview paper included in the proceedings, so this paper presents only a short summary of each track in section 6. The final section looks forward to future TREC conferences.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes Management Information Technologies, Inc.'s (MITi) first involvement in the TREC program. We limited our participation to manual adhoc although our multilingual algorithms can be used for automatic query generation and refinement and are suited for most TREC tasks. We used our commercially available text analysis and retrieval Readware technology to perform the manual adhoc task of finding the documents relevant to fifty specified topics in a pool of more than half a million documents. Readware uses concepts (groups of related words), superconcepts (groups of concepts), Readware query elements (query building blocks) and document subjects to form queries. This is complemented by word search, phrase search and Boolean logic. One MITi analyst performed the task. She formulated an average of 18 queries per topic. The queries were derived intuitively from topic specifications (title, description and narrative). First, a baseline pool of documents was identified for every topic using a few simple queries. Then the analyst queried the baselines using as often as possible Readware query elements related to elements of the topic specification. On average, few hits were returned per query. The analyst also had the advantage of seeing the exact responsive text spots highlighted in every hit document. Queries were adjusted and expanded using information from the neighborhood of the highlighted hit spots. There was no intrinsic ranking of hits. All hits were full semantic matches. The hits were ranked higher after the fact if the queries contained more items. In the 'Best Manual Adhoc' figure of the TREC 7 evaluation results, MITi's graph is above all other participants' graphs at most points.

	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in only four of the tracks that were part of the TREC-T workshop. We worked on ad-hoc retrieval, filtering, VLC, and the SDR track. This report covers the work done on each track successively. We start with a discussion of IR tools that were broadly applied in our work.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The tests we performed for TREC-7 were focused on automatic ad hoc and filtering tasks. With regard to the automatic ad hoc task we assessed two query modification strategies. Both were based on blind relevance feedback processes. The first one carried on with the TREC6 tests: new parameter values of the relevance backpropagation formulas have been tuned. On the other hand, we proposed a new query modification strategy that uses a text mining approach. Three runs were sent. We sent two runs for the relevance backpropagation strategy: one used long topics (titles, descriptions and narratives) and the other one used titles and descriptions. We sent one run for the text mining strategy using long topics. With regard to the filtering task, we sent runs in batch filtering and routing using both relevance backpropagation and gradient neural backpropagation.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year the Zurich team participated in two tracks: the automatic-adhoc track and the crosslingual track. For the adhoc task we focused on improving retrieval for short queries. We pursued two aims. First, we investigated weighting functions for short queries explicitely without any kind of automatic query expansion. Second we developed rules that automatically decide for which queries automatic expansion works fine and for which it does not. For the cross-language track, we approached the problem of retrieving documents from a multilingual document pool containing documents in all TREC CLIR languages. Our method uses individual runs for different language combinations, followed by merging their results into one final ranked list. We obtained good results without sophisticated machine translation or costly linguistic resources.

	The Smart information retrieval project emphasizes completely automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large quantities of text. We continue our work in TREC 7, concentrating on high precision retrieval. In particular, we present an in-depth analysis of our High-Precision Track results, including offering evaluation approaches and measures for time dependent evaluation. We participated in the Query Track, making initial efforts at analyzing query variability, one of the major obstacles for improving retrieval effectiveness.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Techniques for query expansion from top retrieved documents have been recently used by many groups at TREC, often on a purely empirical ground. In this paper we present a novel method for ranking and weighting expansion terms. The method is based on the concept of relative entropy, or Kullback-Lieber distance, developed in Information Theory, from which we derive a computationally simple and theoretically justified formula to assign scores to candidate expansion terms. This method has been incorporated into a comprehensive prototype ranking system, tested in the ad hoc track of TREC-7. The system's overall performance was comparable to median performance of TREC-7 participants, wich is quite good considering that we are new to TREC and that we used unsophisticated indexing and weighting techniques. More focused experiments showed that the use of an information-theoretic component for query expansion significantly improved mean retrieval effectiveness over unexpanded query, yielding performance gains as high as 14% (for non interpolated average precision), while a per-query analysis suggested that queries that are neither too difficult nor too easy can be more easily improved upon.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The main aim of the MultiText experiments for TREC-T was to derive very short queries that would yield high precision and recall, using a hybrid of manual and automatic processes. Identical queries were formulated for adhoc and VLC runs. A query set derived automatically from the topic title words, with an average of 2.84 terms per query, achieved a reasonable but unexceptional average precision for the adhoc task and a median precision @20 for the 100 GB VLC task. However, these short queries achieved very fast retrieval times - less than 1 second per query over 100 GB using four inexpensive PCs. Two further query sets were derived using post-processing of the results of interactive searching on the adhoc corpus. Queries comprising a single conjunction, averaging 1.86 terms, achieved high precision on both adhoc and VLC tasks, and achieved faster retrieval times than the title-word queries. Compound queries averaging 6.42 terms achieved precision values competitive with the best runs, and retrieval times of 1.51 seconds per query on the 100 GB VLC corpus.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Information filtering is increasingly critical to knowledge workers drowning in a growing flood of byte streams [6, 8, 9]. Our interest in the filtering track for TREC-7 grew out of work originally designed for information retrieval on the Web, using both 'traditional' search engine [5] and agent-based techniques [6, 7]. In particular, the work by Cutter, et. al. in clustering [3, 4] has great appeal in the potential for synergistic interaction between user and retrieval system. Our efforts for TREC-7 included two distinct filtering architectures, as well as a more traditional approach to the adhoc track (which used SMART 113). The filtering work was done using TRECcer - our Java-based clustering environment - alone for adaptive filtering and a combination of TRECcer and SMART for batch filtering.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we describe the experiment underlying the CLARITECH entries in the TREC-7 Ad Hoc Retrieval Track. Based on past results, we have come to regard accurate, selective relevance feedback as the dominant factor in effective retrieval. We hypothesized that a clustered rather than a ranked presentation of documents would facilitate judgments of document relevance, allowing a user to judge more documents accurately in a given period of time. This in turn should yield better feedback performance and ultimately better retrieval results. We found that users were indeed able to find more relevant documents in the same time period when results were clustered rather than ranked. Retrieval results from the cluster run were better than results from the ranked run, and those from a combined run were better still. The difference between the ranked and combined runs was statistically significant for both recall and average precision.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In our TREC-5 ad-hoc experiment, we tested two relevance feedback models, an adaptive linear model and a probabilistic model, using massive feedback query expansion (Sumner & Shaw, 1997). For our TREC-6 interactive experiment, we developed an interactive retrieval system called IRIS (Information Retrieval Interactive System'), which implemented modified versions of the feedback models with a three-valued scale of relevance and reduced feedback query expansion (Sumner, Yang, Akers & Shaw, 1998). The goal of the IRIS design was to provide users with ample opportunities to interact with the system throughout the search process. For example, users could supplement the initial query by choosing from a list of statistically significant, two-word collocations, or add and delete query terms as well as change their weights at each search iteration. Unfortunately, it was difficult to tell how much effect each IRIS feature had on the retrieval outcome due to such factors as strong searcher effect and major differences between the experimental and control systems. In our TREC-7 interactive experiment, we attempted to isolate the effect of a given system feature by making the experimental and control systems identical, save for the feature we were studying. In one interactive experiment, the difference between the experimental and control systems was the display and modification capability of term weights. In another experiment, the difference was relevance feedback by passage versus document. For the TREC-7 ad-hoc task, we wanted to examine the effectiveness of relevance feedback using a subcollection in order to lay the groundwork for future participation in the Very Large Corpus experiment. Though the pre-test results showed the retrieval effectiveness of a subcollection approach to be competitive with a whole collection approach, we were not able to execute the subcollection retrieval in the actual ad-hoc experiment due to hardware problems. Instead, our ad-hoc experiment consisted of a simple initial retrieval run and a pseudo-relevance feedback run using the top 5 documents as relevant and the 100* document as non-relevant. Though the precision was high in the top few documents, the ad-hoc results were below average by TREC measures as expected. In the interactive experiment, the passage feedback results were better than the document feedback results, and the results of the simple interface system that did not display query term weights were better than that of the more complex interface system that displayed query term weights and allowed users to change these weights. Overall interactive results were about average among participants.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The GE/Rutgers/SICS/Helsinki team has performed runs in the main ad-hoc task. All submissions are NLP-assisted retrieval. We used two retrieval engines: SMART and InQuery built into the stream model architecture where each stream represents an alternative text indexing method. The processing of TREC data was performed at Helsinki using the commercial Functional Dependency Grammar (FDG) text processing toolkit. Six linguistic streams have been produced, described below. Processed text streams were sent via ftp to Rutgers for indexing. Indexing was done using Inquery system. Additionally, 4 steams produced by GE NLToolset for TREC-6 were reused in SMART indexing. Adhoc topics were processed at GE using both automatic and manual topic expansion. We used the interactive Query Expansion Tool to expand topics with automatically generated summaries of top 30 documents retrieved by the original topic. Manual intervention was restricted to accept/reject decisions on summaries. We observed time limit of 10 minutes per topic. Automatic topics expansion was done by replacing human summary selection by an automatic procedure, which accepted only the summaries that obtained sufficiently high scores. Two sets of expanded topics (automatic and manual) were sent to Helsinki for NL processing, and then on to Rutgers for retrieval. Rankings were obtained from each stream index and then merged using a combined strategy developed at GE and SICS.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year AT&T participated in the ad-hoc task and the Filtering, SDR, and VLC tracks. Most of our effort for TREC-T was concentrated on SDR and VLC tracks. On the filtering track, we tested a preliminary version of a text classification toolkit that we have been developing over the last year. In the ad-hoc task, we introduce a new tf-factor in our term weighting scheme and use a simplified retrieval algorithm. The same weighting scheme and algorithm are used in the SDR and the VLC tracks. The results from the SDR track show that retrieval from automatic transcriptions of speech is quite competitive with doing retrieval from human transcriptions. Our experiments indicate that document expansion can be used to further improve retrieval from automatic transcripts. Results of filtering track are in line with our expectations given the early developmental stage of our classification software. The results of VLC track do not support our hypothesis that retrieval lists from a distributed search can be effectively merged using only the initial part of the documents.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A two-stage model for ad hoc text retrieval is proposed in which recall and precision are maximized sequentially. The first stage employs query expansion methods using WordNet and on a modified stemming algorithm. The second stage incorporates a term proximity-based scoring function and a prototype-based reranking method. The effectiveness of the two-stage retrieval model is tested on the TREC-7 ad hoc text data.

	This paper summarizes the results of the work conducted by FS Consulting, Inc. as part of the Seventh Text Retrieval Experiment Conference (TREC-7). We participated in two components of TREC: (1) Category C, running the Ad Hoc experiments, producing two sets of official results (fsclt7m and fsclt7a) and (2) the Very Large Collection (VLC) track, running the entire experiment, producing the required official results as well as a set of unofficial results. Our long-term research interest is in building information retrieval systems that help users find information to solve real-world problems. Our TREC runs employ two models: for the manual experiments, we have developed a model information systems end-user described more fully in section 5. For the automatic experiments, we use a title-word retrieval model.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes our first large-scale retrieval attempt in TREC-7 using DSIR. DSIR is a vector space based retrieval system in which semantic similarity between words, documents and queries, is interpreted in terms of geometric proximity of vectors in a multi-dimensional space. A co-occurrence matrix computed directly from the collection is used to build the underlying semantic space. We have implemented DSIR on a cluster of low-cost PC Pentium-class machines, and chosen the PVM message-passing library to manage our distributed DSIR version. Although our first adhoc retrieval results are quite poor in terms of recall-precision measure, we believe that more work and experiments have to be explored in order to obtain more promising retrieval performance.

#### Feature Reduction for Information Retrieval

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Our experiments for the ad hoc task were centred around the question how to create a document surrogate that still contains enough information to be used for a high-quality, efficient retrieval. In the first step we drop all the function words and all the auxiliary words that although having a proper meaning merely help to communicate about the topic without being relevant to the topic. We apply part-of-speech analysis in order to retain the nouns and adjectives of a document. Standard term and document frequency analysis is used to compute a weight factor for each of the remaining words. In a second step, we plan to set the relevant words into a relation that conveys a part of the meaning. Like in vector space models, both topic and document would be represented in this keyword-relation form and a suitable metric would quantify the relevance of a document to a topic. At this stage of our research, no relations are stored in document surrogates. The automatic processed topic descriptions, however, include some very crude relation analysis that, eg, transfers 'relevant documents describe cases of drink-driving outside France' to 'drink driving outside France' and hence, knowing about the connotation of '... outside...' a negative weight factor for the occurrence of drink-driving and France. It is planned for future work to analyse relations more and more with statistical models and with trained probabilistic models and less with linguistic analysis. For now, the purpose of our experiments is assessing the performance of the above very simple model of pure feature reduction without relations, without training/learning weights without sophisticated recall procedures, without inverted document files and without a proper document retrieval system. It might be interesting to see which effect feature reduction algorithms have in other, sophisticatedly tuned systems.

	Three runs were submitted: medium (title and description), short (title only) and a run which was a combination of a long run (title, description and narrative) with the medium and short runs. The average precision of the last mentioned run was higher by several percent than any other submitted run, but another participant' recently noticed an impossibly high score for one topic in the short run. This led to the discovery that due to a mistake in the indexing procedures part of the SUBJECT field of the LA Times documents had been indexed. Use of this field was explicitly forbidden in the guidelines [1] for the ad hoc track. The official runs were repeated against a corrected index, and the corrected results are reported below, average precisions being reduced by about 2-4%.

	The University of Maryland participated in three TREC-7 tasks: ad hoc retrieval, cross-language retrieval, and spoken document retrieval. The principal focus of the work was evaluation of merging techniques for cross-language text retrieval from mixed language collections. The results show that biasing the merging strategy in favor of documents in the query language can be helpful. Ad hoc and spoken document retrieval results are also presented.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	IBM participated in two tracks at TREC-7: ad hoc and cross-language. In the adhoc task we contrasted the performance of two different query expansion techniques: local context analysis and probabilistic model. Two themes characterize IBM's participation in the CLIR track at TREC-7. The first is the use of statistical methods. In order to use the document translation approach, we built a fast (translation time within an order of magnitude of the indexing time) French= English translation model trained from parallel corpora. We also trained German‚ÜíFrench and Italian‚ÜíFrench translation models entirely from comparable corpora. The unique characteristic of the work described here is that all bilingual resources and translation models were learned automatically from corpora (parallel and comparable.) The other theme is that the widely varying quality and availability of bilingual resources means that language pairs must be treated separately. We will describe methods for using one language as a pivot language in order to decrease the number pairs, as well as methods for merging the results from several retrievals.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In the second year of the use of Semantic Forests in TREC, we have raised our 30-document average precision in the automatic Ad Hoc task to 27% from 19% last year. We also contributed a significant number of unique relevant documents to the judgement pool [3]. Our mean average precisions on the SDR task are roughly the median performance for that task [4]. The Semantic Forests algorithm was originally developed by Schone and Nelson [1] for labeling topics in text and transcribed speech. Semantic Forests uses an electronic dictionary to make a tree for each word in a text document. The root of the tree is the word from the document, the first branches are the words in the definition of the root word, the next branches are the words in the definitions of the words in the first branches, and so on. The words in the trees are tagged by part of speech and given weights based on statistics gathered during training. Finally, the trees are merged into a scored list of words. The premise is that words in common between trees will be reinforced and represent 'topics' present in the document. With minor modifications, queries are treated as documents. Seven major changes were made in developing this year's system from last year's. (1) A number of pre-processing steps which were performed last year (such as identifying multi-word units) were incorporated into Semantic Forests. (2) A part of speech tagger was added, allowing Semantic Forests to use this additional information. (3) Semantic Forests distinguishes between queries and documents this year, since our experiments indicated they needed to be treated differently. (4) Only the first three letters of words which do not occur in the dictionary are retained, instead of the entire word. (5) A parameter directs Semantic Forests to break each document into segments containing at most a set number of words, typically 500. 6) The algorithms used by Semantic Forests to assign and combine word weights have been improved. (7) Quasi-relevance feedback was implemented and evaluated.

	This paper describes the official runs of the Twenty-One group for TREC-7. The Twenty-One group participated in the ad-hoc and the cross-language track and made the following accom-plishments: We developed a new weighting algorithm, which outperforms the popular Cornell version of BM25 on the ad-hoc collection. For the CLIR task we developed a fuzzy matching algorithm to recover from missing translations and spelling variants of proper names. Also for CLIR we investigated translation strategies that make extensive use of information from our dictionaries by identifying preferred translations, main translations and synonym translations, by defining weights of possible translations and by experimenting with probabilistic boolean matching strategies.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This is KDD R&D Laboratories' first participation in TREC. In this participation, we focused on experiments on a novel method of query expansion. The query expansion method described in this paper is based on a measure we call 'word contribution'. Word contribution is a measure which expresses the influence of a word to the similarity between the query and a document. From our data, we figured that words which have highly negative contribution can be considered as to being expressive of the characteristics of the data (query or document) in which they exist. We proposed extracting such words from documents highly similar to a query, and adding them to the original query to generate an expanded query. We made experiments to evaluate this method, and reported the results in this paper. We submitted 3 official ad hoc runs (KD70000, KD71010q, KD71010s) to TREC-7. However, the data we used for these runs were generated by a buggy morphological analysis program, which we consider a serious cause for our bad results. Since the official submission, we have fixed these bugs, and reconstructured our data. The results described in this paper are based on these new data, and some experiments made after the TREC-T con-terence.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in the main task of automatic ad-hoc retrieval as well as the high precision and filtering tracks. For ad-hoc, three experiments were done with query types of short (title section of a topic), medium (description section) and long (all sections) lengths. We used a sequence of five methods to handle the short and medium length queries. For long queries we employed a re-ranking method based on evidence from matching query phrases in document windows in both stages of a 2-stage retrieval. Results are well above median. For high precision track, we employed our interactive PIRCS system for the first time. In adaptive filtering, we concentrate on dynamically varying the retrieval status value threshold for deciding selection and during the course of filtering. Query weights were trained but expansion was not done. We also submitted results for batch filtering and standard routing based on methods evolved from previous TREC experiments.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Experiments relating to TREC-7 Ad Hoc, HP and VLC tasks are described and results reported. Minor refinements of last year's Ad Hoc methods do not appear to have resulted in worthwile improvements in performance. However, larger benefits were gained from automatic feedback than last year and concept scoring was very beneficial in the Manual Ad Hoc category. In the Automatic Ad Hoc category title-only performance seems to have suffered more severely than long-topic from a number of lexical scanning shortcomings and from an excessive stopword list. The HP track was used to validate the usibility of the combination of PADRE and the Quokka GUI. In the VLC track, the 100 gigabyte collection was indexed in under eight hours and moderately effective queries were processed in less than two seconds.

	In our first participation in TREC, our focus was on improving the basic ranking systems and applying text clustering techniques for query ex-pansion. We tested a variety of techiniques including reference measures, passage retrieval, and data fusion for the basic ranking systems. Some te-chiniques were used in the official run, others were not used because of time limitations. We applied the text clustering techiniques for query expansion with a text clustering engine. Clustering base query expansion uses the top N best text clusters from the top 1000 documents instead of just using the top N documents. Clustering base query expansion produces better results than simple query expansion based on passage retrieval. We submitted three runs, Flab7at, Flab7ad, and Flab7atE. Flabat is combination of ranking and query expansion by clustering the top 1000 documents on the title field, Flabad is combination of ranking and query expansion by clustering on the description field, and Flab7atE is combination of ranking with Boolean (exis-tence) operators and query expansion by passage retrieval.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in the ad-hoc task (main task) and the filtering track (sub task). In the ad-hoc task, we adopted a scoring method that used co-occurrence term relations in a document and specific processing in order to determine which conceptual parts of the documents should be targeted for query expansion. In filtering, we adopted a machine-readable dictionary for detecting idioms and an inductive learning algorithm for detecting important co-occurrences of terms. In this paper, we describe the system approach and discuss the evaluation results in brief for our ad-hoc and filtering in TREC-7.

	We present a new method for information retrieval using hidden Markov models (HMMs) and relate our experience with this system on the TREC-7 ad hoc task. We develop a general framework for incorporating multiple word generation mechanisms within the same model. We then demonstrate that an extremely simple realization of this model substantially outperforms tf.idf ranking on both the TREC-6 and TREC-7 ad hoc retrieval tasks. We go on to present several algorithmic refinements, including a novel method for performing blind feedback in the HMM framework. Together, these methods form a state-of-the-art retrieval system that ranked among the best on the TREC-7 ad hoc retrieval task, and showed extraordinary performance in development experiments on TREC-6.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Harris Corporation focuses on information retrieval support for various Government agencies. Time constraints and interest-level limit our user to reviewing the top documents before determining if the results of a query are accurate and satisfactory. In such cases, retrieval times and precision accuracy are at a premium, with recall potentially being compromised. To meet user demands our system, called SENTINEL, was designed to yield efficient, high precision retrieval. This is the second time Harris has participated in the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). We learned a lot from our first TREC [Knepper-97]. This year, we enhanced several aspects of our retrieval system and improved our performance over last year's results.

	The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) is a first-time entrant in the TREC Category A evaluation. The focus of our information retrieval research is on the relative value of and interaction among multiple term types. In particular, we are interested in examining both words and n-grams as indexing terms. The relative values of words and n-grams have been disputed; to our knowledge though, no one has previously studied their relative merits while holding all other aspects of the system constant.

	This paper describe our method in automatic-adhoc task of TREC-7. We propose a method to improve the performance of information retrieval system by expanded the query using 3 diffferent types of thesaurus. The expansion terms are taken from handcrafted thesaurus (WordNet), co-occurrence-based automatically constructed thesaurus, and syntactically predicate-argument based automatically constructed thesaurus.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper presents different methods tested by the University of Avignon and Bertin at the TREC-7 evaluation. A first section describes several methodologies used for query expansion: synonymy and stemming. Relevance feedback is applied both to the TIPSTER corpora and Internet documents. In a second section, we describe a classification algorithm based on hierarchical and clustering methods. This algorithm improves results given by any Information Retrieval system (that retrieves a list of documents from a query) and helps the users by automatically providing a structured document map from the set of retrieved documents. Lastly, we present the first results obtained with TREC-6 and TREC-7 corpora and queries by using this algorithm.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC-7, the Berkeley ad-hoc experiments explored more phrase discovery in topics and documents. We utilized Boolean retrieval combined with probabilistic ranking for 17 topics in ad-hoc manual entry. Our cross-language experiments tested 3 different widely available machine translation software packages. For language pairs (e.g. German to French) for which no direct machine translation was available we made use of English as a universal intermediate language. For CLIR we also manually reformulated the English topics before doing machine translation, and this elicited a significant performance increase for both quad language retrieval and for English against English and French documents. In our Interactive Track entry eight searchers conducted eight searches each, half on the Cheshire II system and the other half on the Zprise system, for a total of 64 searches. Questionnaires were administered to gather information about basic demographic and searching experience, about each search, about each of the systems, and finally, about the user's perceptions of the systems.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in both the automatic and manual tracks for category A. For the automatic runs, we included a baseline run and an experimental run that filtered relevance feedback using proper nouns. The baseline run used the short query versions and term thresholding to focus on the most meaningful terms. The experimental run used the long queries (title, description and narrative) with relevance feedback that filtered for proper nouns. Information extraction tools were used to identify proper nouns. For manual runs, we used predefined concept lists with terms from the concept lists combined in different ways. The manual run focused on using phrases and proper nouns in the query. We continued to use the NCR/Teradata DBC-1012 Model 4 parallel database machine as the primary platform and added an implementation on Sybase IQ. We again used the relational database model implemented with unchanged SQL. In addition, we enhanced our system by implementing new stop word lists for terms and selecting phrases based on association scores. Our results, while not dramatic, indicate that further work in merging information extraction and information retrieval is warranted.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	The main aim of the MultiText experiments for TREC-7 was to derive very short queries that would yield high precision and recall, using a hybrid of manual and automatic processes. Identical queries were formulated for adhoc and VLC runs. A query set derived automatically from the topic title words, with an average of 2.84 terms per query, achieved a reasonable but unexceptional average precision for the adhoc task and a median precision @20 for the 100 GB VLC task. However, these short queries achieved very fast retrieval times ‚Äî less than 1 second per query over 100 GB using four inexpensive PCs. Two further query sets were derived using post-processing of the results of interactive searching on the adhoc corpus. Queries comprising a single conjunction, averaging 1.86 terms, achieved high precision on both adhoc and VLC tasks, and achieved faster retrieval times than the title-word queries. Compound queries averaging 6.42 terms achieved precision values competitive with the best runs, and retrieval times of 1.51 seconds per query on the 100 GB VLC corpus.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in the main task of automatic ad-hoc retrieval as well as the high precision and filtering tracks. For ad-hoc, three experiments were done with query types of short (title section of a topic), medium (description section) and long (all sections) lengths. We used a sequence of five methods to handle the short and medium length queries. For long queries we employed a re-ranking method based on evidence from matching query phrases in document windows in both stages of a 2-stage retrieval. Results are well above median. For high precision track, we employed our interactive PIRCS system for the first time. In adaptive filtering, we concentrate on dynamically varying the retrieval status value threshold for deciding selection and during the course of filtering. Query weights were trained but expansion was not done. We also submitted results for batch filtering and standard routing based on methods evolved from previous TREC experiments.

	Experiments relating to TREC-7 Ad Hoc, HP and VLC tasks are described and results reported. Minor refinements of last year's Ad Hoc methods do not appear to have resulted in worthwile improvements in performance. However, larger benefits were gained from automatic feedback than last year and concept scoring was very beneficial in the Manual Ad Hoc category. In the Automatic Ad Hoc category title-only performance seems to have suffered more severely than long-topic from a number of lexical scanning shortcomings and from an excessive stopword list. The HP track was used to validate the usibility of the combination of PADRE and the Quokka GUI. In the VLC track, the 100 gigabyte collection was indexed in under eight hours and moderately effective queries were processed in less than two seconds.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This article describes the experiments conducted in the TREC-7 filtering track, which consisted of three subtasks: adaptive filtering, batch filtering, and routing. The focus this year is on adaptive filtering, where the system begins with only the topic statement and must interactively adjust a filtering profile constructed from that topic in response to on-line feedback. In addition to motivating the task and describing the practical details of participating in the track, this document includes a detailed graphical presentation of the experimental results and provides a brief overall analysis of the performance data.

	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in only four of the tracks that were part of the TREC-7 workshop. We worked on ad-hoc retrieval, filtering, VLC, and the SDR track. This report covers the work done on each track successively. We start with a discussion of IR tools that were broadly applied in our work.

	The tests we performed for TREC-7 were focused on automatic ad hoc and filtering tasks. With regard to the automatic ad hoc task we assessed two query modification strategies. Both were based on blind relevance feedback processes. The first one carried on with the TREC6 tests: new parameter values of the relevance backpropagation formulas have been tuned. On the other hand, we proposed a new query modification strategy that uses a text mining approach. Three runs were sent. We sent two runs for the relevance backpropagation strategy: one used long topics (titles, descriptions and narratives) and the other one used titles and descriptions. We sent one run for the text mining strategy using long topics. With regard to the filtering task, we sent runs in batch filtering and routing using both relevance backpropagation and gradient neural backpropagation.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Information filtering is increasingly critical to knowledge workers drowning in a growing flood of byte streams [6, 8, 9]. Our interest in the filtering track for TREC-7 grew out of work originally designed for information retrieval on the Web, using both 'traditional' search engine [5] and agent-based techniques [6, 7]. In particular, the work by Cutter, et. al. in clustering [3, 4] has great appeal in the potential for synergistic interaction between user and retrieval system. Our efforts for TREC-7 included two distinct filtering architectures, as well as a more traditional approach to the adhoc track (which used SMART 11.3). The filtering work was done using TRECcer - our Java-based clustering environment - alone for adaptive filtering and a combination of TRECcer and SMART for batch filtering.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this paper, we describe the system and methods used for the CLARITECH entries in the TREC-7 Filtering Track. Our main aim was to study algorithms, designs, and parameters for Adaptive Filtering, as this comes closest to actual applications. For efficiency's sake, however, we adapted a system largely geared towards retrieval and introduced a few critical new components. The first of these components, the delivery ratio mechanism, is used to obtain a profile threshold when no feedback has been received. A second method, which we call beta gamma regulation, is used for threshold updating. It takes into account the number of judged documents processed by the system as well as an expected bias in optimal threshold calculation. Several parameters were determined empirically: apart from the parameters pertaining to the new components, we also experimented with different choices for the reference corpus, and different 'chunk' sizes for processing news stories. Gradually increasing chunk sizes over 'time' appears to help profile learning. Finally, we examined the effect of terminating underperforming queries over the AP90 corpus and found that the utility metric over AP88-AP89 was a good predictor. All of the above innovations contributed to the success of the CLARITECH system in the adaptive filtering track.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year AT&T participated in the ad-hoc task and the Filtering, SDR, and VLC tracks. Most of our effort for TREC-T was concentrated on SDR and VLC tracks. On the filtering track, we tested a preliminary version of a text classification toolkit that we have been developing over the last year. In the ad-hoc task, we introduce a new tf-factor in our term weighting scheme and use a simplified retrieval algorithm. The same weighting scheme and algorithm are used in the SDR and the VLC tracks. The results from the SDR track show that retrieval from automatic transcriptions of speech is quite competitive with doing retrieval from human transcriptions. Our experiments indicate that document expansion can be used to further improve retrieval from automatic transcripts. Results of filtering track are in line with our expectations given the early developmental stage of our classification software. The results of VLC track do not support our hypothesis that retrieval lists from a distributed search can be effectively merged using only the initial part of the documents.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year saw a major departure from the previous Okapi approach to routing and filtering. We concentrated our efforts on the twin problems of (a) starting from scratch, with no assumed history of relevance judgments for each topic, and (b) having to define a threshold for retrieval. The thresholding problem is interesting and difficult; we associate it with the problem of assigning an explicit estimate of the probability of relevance to each document. We describe and test a set of methods for initializing the profile for each threshold and for modifying it as time passes. Two pairs of runs were submitted: in one pair queries remained constant, but in the other query terms were reweighted when fresh relevance information became available.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In TREC-7, we participated in the main task of automatic ad-hoc retrieval as well as the high precision and filtering tracks. For ad-hoc, three experiments were done with query types of short (title section of a topic), medium (description section) and long (all sections) lengths. We used a sequence of five methods to handle the short and medium length queries. For long queries we employed a re-ranking method based on evidence from matching query phrases in document windows in both stages of a 2-stage retrieval. Results are well above median. For high precision track, we employed our interactive PIRCS system for the first time. In adaptive filtering, we concentrate on dynamically varying the retrieval status value threshold for deciding selection and during the course of filtering. Query weights were trained but expansion was not done. We also submitted results for batch filtering and standard routing based on methods evolved from previous TREC experiments.

	In TREC-T, we participated in the ad-hoc task (main task) and the filtering track (sub task). In the ad-hoc task, we adopted a scoring method that used co-occurrence term relations in a document and specific processing in order to determine which conceptual parts of the documents should be targeted for query expansion. In filtering, we adopted a machine-readable dictionary for detecting idioms and an inductive learning algorithm for detecting important co-occurrences of terms. In this paper, we describe the system approach and discuss the evaluation results in brief for our ad-hoc and filtering in TREC-7.

	This paper presents work done at Cambridge University, on the TREC-7 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) Track. The broadcast news audio was transcribed using a 2-pass gender-dependent HTK speech recog-niser which ran at 50 times real time and gave an overall word error rate of 24.8%, the lowest in the track. The Okapi-based retrieval engine used in TREC-6 by the City/Cambridge University collaboration was supplemented by improving the stop-list, adding a bad-spelling mapper and stemmer exceptions list, adding word-pair information, integrating part-of-speech weighting on query terms and including some pre-search statistical expansion. The final system gave an average precision of 0.4817 on the reference and 0.4509 on the automatic tran-scription, with the R-precision being 0.4603 and 0.4330 respectively. The paper also presents results on a new set of 60 queries with assessments for the TREC-6 test document data used for development pur-poses, and analyses the relationship between recognition accuracy, as defined by a pre-processed term error rate, and retrieval performance for both sets of data.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This paper describes the THISL system that participated in the TREC-7 evaluation, Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) Track, and presents the results obtained, together with some analysis. The THISL system is based on the ABBOT speech recognition system and the thislIR text retrieval system. In this evaluation we were concerned with investigating the suitability for SDR of a recognizer running at less than ten times realtime, the use of multiple transcriptions and word graphs, the effect of simple query expansion algorithms and the effect of varying standard IR parameters.

	This year the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts participated in only four of the tracks that were part of the TREC-T workshop. We worked on ad-hoc retrieval, filtering, VLC, and the SDR track. This report covers the work done on each track successively. We start with a discussion of IR tools that were broadly applied in our work.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year AT&T participated in the ad-hoc task and the Filtering, SDR, and VLC tracks. Most of our effort for TREC-7 was concentrated on SDR and VLC tracks. On the filtering track, we tested a preliminary version of a text classification toolkit that we have been developing over the last year. In the ad-hoc task, we introduce a new tf-factor in our term weighting scheme and use a simplified retrieval algorithm. The same weighting scheme and algorithm are used in the SDR and the VLC tracks. The results from the SDR track show that retrieval from automatic transcriptions of speech is quite competitive with doing retrieval from human transcriptions. Our experiments indicate that document expansion can be used to further improve retrieval from automatic transcripts. Results of filtering track are in line with our expectations given the early developmental stage of our classification software. The results of VLC track do not support our hypothesis that retrieval lists from a distributed search can be effectively merged using only the initial part of the documents.

	We describe our submission to the TREC-7 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) track and the speech recognition and information retrieval engines. We present SDR evaluation results and a brief analysis. A few developments are also described in greater detail including: A new, probabilistic retrieval engine based on language models. A new, TFIDF-based weighting function that incorporates word error probability. The use of a simple confidence estimate for word probability based on speech recognition lattices. Although improvements over a development test set were promising, the new techniques failed to yield significant gains in the evaluation test set.

	The University of Maryland participated in three TREC-7 tasks: ad hoc retrieval, cross-language retrieval, and spoken document retrieval. The principal focus of the work was evaluation of merging techniques for cross-language text retrieval from mixed language collections. The results show that biasing the merging strategy in favor of documents in the query language can be helpful. Ad hoc and spoken document retrieval results are also presented.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	A small amount of internal funding allowed DERA-SRU to participate in the TREC-7 SDR evaluations for the first time this year. Since we had almost no experience of entering this or related NIST evaluations (e.g. ARPA HUB-4 LVCSR) there was a rather steep learning curve along with intense development of the experimental infrastructure. The intention was to generate a base for future participation and to build upon this using experience gained from related work on topic spotting. To this end, a straightforward (i.e. non-optimised) speech recogniser was used to generate transcripts and retrieval was performed using the okapi [6,9] search engine. Previous work on topic spotting [7] suggested that term expansion using a semantic network (in this case wordnet [2,3]) might be useful. This hypothesis appeared to be supported by preliminary work on TREC-6 SDR data which yielded text (i.e. R1) results that were comparable with the best achieved elsewhere.

#### Text Retrieval via Semantic Forests: TREC7

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In the second year of the use of Semantic Forests in TREC, we have raised our 30-document average precision in the automatic Ad Hoc task to 27% from 19% last year. We also contributed a significant number of unique relevant documents to the judgement pool [3]. Our mean average precisions on the SDR task are roughly the median performance for that task [4]. The Semantic Forests algorithm was originally developed by Schone and Nelson [1] for labeling topics in text and transcribed speech. Semantic Forests uses an electronic dictionary to make a tree for each word in a text document. The root of the tree is the word from the document, the first branches are the words in the definition of the root word, the next branches are the words in the definitions of the words in the first branches, and so on. The words in the trees are tagged by part of speech and given weights based on statistics gathered during training. Finally, the trees are merged into a scored list of words. The premise is that words in common between trees will be reinforced and represent 'topics' present in the document. With minor modifications, queries are treated as documents. Seven major changes were made in developing this year's system from last year's. (1) A number of pre-processing steps which were performed last year (such as identifying multi-word units) were incorporated into Semantic Forests. (2) A part of speech tagger was added, allowing Semantic Forests to use this additional information. (3) Semantic Forests distinguishes between queries and documents this year, since our experiments indicated they needed to be treated differently. (4) Only the first three letters of words which do not occur in the dictionary are retained, instead of the entire word. (5) A parameter directs Semantic Forests to break each document into segments containing at most a set number of words, typically 500. 6) The algorithms used by Semantic Forests to assign and combine word weights have been improved. (7) Quasi-relevance feedback was implemented and evaluated.

	This paper presents work done at Cambridge University, on the TREC-7 Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) Track. The broadcast news audio was transcribed using a 2-pass gender-dependent HTK speech recog-niser which ran at 50 times real time and gave an overall word error rate of 24.8%, the lowest in the track. The Okapi-based retrieval engine used in TREC-6 by the City/Cambridge University collaboration was supplemented by improving the stop-list, adding a bad-spelling mapper and stemmer exceptions list, adding word-pair information, integrating part-of-speech weighting on query terms and including some pre-search statistical expansion. The final system gave an average precision of 0.4817 on the reference and 0.4509 on the automatic tran-scription, with the R-precision being 0.4603 and 0.4330 respectively. The paper also presents results on a new set of 60 queries with assessments for the TREC-6 test document data used for development pur-poses, and analyses the relationship between recognition accuracy, as defined by a pre-processed term error rate, and retrieval performance for both sets of data.

## Cross-Language 

#### Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) Track Overview

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This year, the TREC cross-language retrieval track took place for the second time. In TREC-7, we extended the task presented to the participants. The goal was for groups to use queries written in a single language in order to retrieve documents from a multilingual pool of documents written in many different languages. This is also a more comprehensive task than the usual definition of cross-language information retrieval, where systems work with a language pair, retrieving documents in a language Ll using queries in language L2. The document languages used this year were English, German, French, and, newly introduced for TREC-7, Italian. The queries were available in all of these languages. Because it seemed unlikely that all interested parties can work with all four languages, it was agreed that there would be a secondary evaluation involving a smaller task. Consequently, groups were allowed to send in runs using the English queries to retrieve documents from a subset of the pool containing just the English and French documents. Coordination of the track took place at ETH in Zurich, as for last year. The continued interest in the cross-language track showed the importance of this emerging area. There are many applications where information should be accessible to users regardless of its language. With the ever growing amount of information available to us all, situations when a user of an information retrieval system is faced with the task of querying a multilingual document collection are becoming increasingly common. Such collections can be made up of documents from multinational companies, from multilingual countries or from large international organizations such as the United Nations or the European Commission. Of course, the world wide web is also an example for such a document collection. A lot of users of such multilingual data sources have some foreign language knowledge, but their proficiency may not be good enough to formulate queries to appropriately express their information need. Such users will beneft greatly if they can enter queries in their native language, because they will be able to inspect the documents even if they are untranslated. Monolingual users, on the other hand, can use translation aids, manual or automatic, to help them access the search results.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	In this report we describe our model of dynamic hypertext and how the ClickIR system uses this model to assist users in interactive search. The system was used in both the ad hoc task and the interactive track. In the context of the ad hoc task we were interested in the effects relevance feedback would have on our system. Comparison of ClickIR performance with and without relevance feedback showed that relevance feedback was critical in boosting the performance of the system from below median performance to the upper rank of TREC-7 systems. In the interactive track we compared the ClickIR (experimental) system where the tasks of querying and browsing were integrated, with a system which closely approximated a Web search engine, where the task of querying is separated from the task of browsing a list of hits. A trade-off between recall and precision was observed, with ClickIR leading to significantly greater recall, but at the expense of significantly lower precision and longer time taken to perform the task.

#### TREC-7 Evaluation of Conceptual Interlingua Document Retrieval (CINDOR)  in English and French

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	TextWise LLC. participated in the TREC-7 Cross-Language Retrieval track using the CINDOR system, which utilizes a 'conceptual interlingua' representation of documents and queries. The current CINDOR research system uses a conceptual interlingua constructed around the Princeton WordNet, which we are mapping into French and Spanish. The use of an interlingual representation of documents and queries allows us to perform retrieval on any combination of supported languages, rather than having to rely on pairwise translations, while the use of a resource like WordNet allows us to match equivalent terms (including synonyms) across languages. Although the analysis of our TREC-7 results is clouded somewhat by the kinds of system errors which inevitably occur in a first-time evaluation over large TREC corpora, our evaluation of the conceptual interlingua approach suggests that it provides highly effective cross-language retrieval performance. In particular, we notice that the CINDOR system achieves cross-language retrieval results equivalent in many cases to corresponding monolingual queries, without the loss in retrieval precision observed in many other approaches to cross-language retrieval. Future work on the CINDOR system, which was evaluated here in its research prototype form, will focus on improving further the coverage of our conceptual interlingua resources and the efficiency of our document processing modules. We are also investigating the construction of an interlingual resource of proper nouns, using technology from other TextWise products, since proper nouns constitute the largest category of 'out-of-vocabulary' terms with respect to our current conceptual interlingua knowledge base. We will also continue to adapt the CINDOR system to handle more languages.

	The University of Maryland participated in three TREC-7 tasks: ad hoc retrieval, cross-language retrieval, and spoken document retrieval. The principal focus of the work was evaluation of merging techniques for cross-language text retrieval from mixed language collections. The results show that biasing the merging strategy in favor of documents in the query language can be helpful. Ad hoc and spoken document retrieval results are also presented.

	In this report, we describe the approach we used in TREC-7 Cross-Language IR (CLIR) track. The approach is based on a probabilistic translation model estimated from a parallel training corpus (Canadian HANSARD). The problem of translating a query from a language to another (between French and English) becomes the problem of determining the most probable words that may appear in the translation of the query. In this paper, we will describe the principle of building the probabilistic model, and the runs we submitted using the model as a translation tool.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	IBM participated in two tracks at TREC-7: ad hoc and cross-language. the adhoc task we contrasted the performance of two different query expansion techniques: local context analysis and probabilistic model. Two themes characterize IBM's participation in the CLIR track at TREC-7. The first is the use of statistical methods. In order to use the document translation approach, we built a fast (translation time within an order of magnitude of the indexing time) French‚ÜíEnglish translation model trained from parallel corpora. We also trained German‚ÜíFrench and Italian=French translation models entirely from comparable corpora. The unique characteristic of the work described here is that all bilingual resources and translation models were learned automatically from corpora (parallel and comparable.) The other theme is that the widely varying quality and availability of bilingual resources means that language pairs must be treated separately. We will describe methods for using one language as a pivot language in order to decrease the number pairs, as well as methods for merging the results from several retrievals.

	This paper describes the official runs of the Twenty-One group for TREC-7. The Twenty-One group participated in the ad-hoc and the cross-language track and made the following accom-plishments: We developed a new weighting algorithm, which outperforms the popular Cornell version of BM25 on the ad-hoc collection. For the CLIR task we developed a fuzzy matching algorithm to recover from missing translations and spelling variants of proper names. Also for CLIR we investigated translation strategies that make extensive use of information from our dictionaries by identifying preferred translations, main translations and synonym translations, by defining weights of possible translations and by experimenting with probabilistic boolean matching strategies.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC-7, the Berkeley ad-hoc experiments explored more phrase discovery in topics and documents. We utilized Boolean retrieval combined with probabilistic ranking for 17 topics in ad-hoc manual entry. Our cross-language experiments tested 3 different widely available machine translation software packages. For language pairs (e.g. German to French) for which no direct machine translation was available we made use of English as a universal intermediate language. For CLIR we also manually reformulated the English topics before doing machine translation, and this elicited a significant performance increase for both quad language retrieval and for English against English and French documents. In our Interactive Track entry eight searchers conducted eight searches each, half on the Cheshire II system and the other half on the Zprise system, for a total of 64 searches. Questionnaires were administered to gather information about basic demographic and searching experience, about each search, about each of the systems, and finally, about the user's perceptions of the systems.

	The Smart information retrieval project emphasizes completely automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large quantities of text. We continue our work in TREC 7, concentrating on high precision retrieval. In particular, we present an in-depth analysis of our High-Precision Track results, including offering evaluation approaches and measures for time dependent evaluation. We participated in the Query Track, making initial efforts at analyzing query variability, one of the major obstacles for improving retrieval effectiveness.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	This report is an introduction to the work of the TREC-7 Interactive Track with its goal of investigating interactive information retrieval by examining the process as well as the results. Eight research groups ran a total of 15 interactive information retrieval (IR) systems on a shared prob-lem: a question-answering task, eight statements of information need, and a collection of 210,158 articles from the Financial Times of London 1991-1994. This report summarizes the shared experimental framework, which for TREC-7 was designed to support analysis and comparison of system performance only within sites. The report refers the reader to separate discussions of the experiments performed by each participating group - their hypotheses, experimental systems, and results. The papers from each of the participating groups and the raw and evaluated results are available via the TREC home page (trec.nist.gov).

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	We present results of a study comparing two different interactive information retrieval systems: one which supports positive relevance feedback as a term-suggestion device; the other which supports both positive and negative relevance feedback in this same context. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and usability of a specific implementation of negative relevance feedback in interactive information retrieval. A second purpose was to investigate the effectiveness and usability of relevance feedback implemented as a term-suggestion device. The results suggest that, although there was no benefit in terms of performance for the system with negative and positive relevance feedback, this might be due to specific implementation issues.

	Experiments are presented based on unofficial results for TREC-7. Eigensystems analysis of a term co-occurrence matrix is compared to eigensystems analysis of a term correlation matrix. For each matrix type, the effect of term weighting and document length normalization is assessed. Recall-precision curves and other TREC statistics indicate that the use of the correlation matrix improves performance regardless of what term weighting or document length normalization is used.

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	Studies comparing Boolean and natural language searching with actual end-users are still inconclusive. The TREC interactive track provides a consensus-developed protocol for assessing this and other user-oriented information retrieval research questions. We recruited 28 experienced information professionals with library degrees to participate in this year's TREC-7 interactive experiment. Our results showed that this was a highly experienced group of searchers who performed equally well with both types of systems.

- :material-file-search: **Runs:** [C-Z](./interactive/runs.md#c-z)

??? abstract "Abstract"
	
	For TREC-7, the Berkeley ad-hoc experiments explored more phrase discovery in topics and documents. We utilized Boolean retrieval combined with probabilistic ranking for 17 topics in ad-hoc manual entry. Our cross-language experiments tested 3 different widely available machine translation software packages. For language pairs (e.g. German to French) for which no direct machine translation was available we made use of English as a universal intermediate language. For CLIR we also manually reformulated the English topics before doing machine translation, and this elicited a significant performance increase for both quad language retrieval and for English against English and French documents. In our Interactive Track entry eight searchers conducted eight searches each, half on the Cheshire II system and the other half on the Zprise system, for a total of 64 searches. Questionnaires were administered to gather information about basic demographic and searching experience, about each search, about each of the systems, and finally, about the user's perceptions of the systems.
