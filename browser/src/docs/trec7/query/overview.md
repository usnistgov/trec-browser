General IR research is being held up because we don't have enough queries of various types to investigate advanced retrieval techniques that are query dependent. There's no way we can get enough relevance judgements on new queries to form a good query pool. The Query track looks at multiple query variations of past TREC topics to get a large number of query formulations.
