Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) involves the search and retrieval of excerpts from recordings of speech using a combination of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval techniques. In performing SDR, a speech recognition engine is applied to an audio input stream and generates a time-marked textual representation (transcription) of the speech. The transcription is then indexed and may be searched using an information retrieval engine. In traditional information retrieval, a topic (or query) results in a rank-ordered list of documents. In SDR, a topic results in a rank-ordered list of temporal pointers to potentially relevant excerpts. In an operational SDR system, these excerpts could be topical sections of a recording of a conference or radio or television broadcasts.
