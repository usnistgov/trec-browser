This year, the TREC cross-language retrieval track took place for the second time. In TREC-7, we extended the task presented to the participants. The goal was for groups to use queries written in a single language in order to retrieve documents from a multilingual pool of documents written in many different languages. This is also a more comprehensive task than the usual definition of cross-language information retrieval, where systems work with a language pair, retrieving documents in a language L1 using queries in language L2.
