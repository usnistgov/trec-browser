The TREC-8 Question Answering track was the first large scale evaluation of domain-independent question answering systems. This paper summarizes the results of the track by giving a brief overview of the different approaches taken to solve the problem. The most accurate systems found a correct response for more than 2/3 of the questions. Relatively simple bag-of-words approaches were adequate for finding answers when responses could be as long as a paragraph (250 bytes), but more sophisticated processing was necessary for more direct responses (50 bytes).
