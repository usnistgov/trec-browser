SDR involves the search and retrieval of excerpts from spoken audio recordings using a combination of automatic speech recognition and information retrieval technologies. The TREC SDR Track has provided an infrastructure for the development and evaluation of SDR technology and a common forum for the exchange of knowledge between the speech recognition and information retrieval research communities. The SDR Track can be declared a success in that it has provided objective, demonstrable proof that this technology can be successfully applied to realistic audio collections using a combination of existing technologies and that it can be objectively evaluated.
