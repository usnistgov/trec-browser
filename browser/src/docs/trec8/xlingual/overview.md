{==

A cross-language retrieval track was offered for the third time at TREC-8. The main task was the same as that of the previous year: the goal was for groups to use queries written in a single language in order to retrieve documents from a multilingual pool of documents written in many different languages. Compared to the usual definition of cross-language information retrieval, where systems work with a single language pair, retrieving documents in a language L1 using queries in language L2, this is a slightly more comprehensive task, and we feel one that more closely meets the demands of real world applications.
