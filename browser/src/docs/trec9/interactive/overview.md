The TREC Interactive Track has the goal of investigating interactive information retrieval by examining the process as well as the results. In TREC-9 six research groups ran a total of 12 interactive information retrieval (IR) system variants on a shared problem: a fact-finding task, eight questions, and newspaper/newswire documents from the TREC collections. This report summarizes the shared experimental framework, which for TREC-9 was designed to support analysis and comparison of system performance only within sites.
