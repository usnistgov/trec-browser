{==

The Query Track in TREC-9 is unlike the other tracks in TREC. The other tracks attempt to compare systems to determine the best approaches to solve the particular track problem. This comparison is normally done over a given set of topics, with a single query per topic. The Query Track, on the other hand, compares multiple queries on a single topic to determine which queries perform best with which systems. There is no emphasis on system-system comparisons: none of the participating systems were even the most advanced system from that particular participating group. Instead, the goal is to try and understand how the statement (query) of the user's information need (topic) affects retrieval.
